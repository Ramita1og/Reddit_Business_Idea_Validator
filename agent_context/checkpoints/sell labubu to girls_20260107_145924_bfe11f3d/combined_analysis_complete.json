            "title": "AITA for not making my daughter switch back a gifted Labubu with her younger cousin after her uncle found out the one my daughter gained in the swap is rare with a high resale value?",
            "content": "Throwaway because family is on Reddit.\n\nThis happened over Christmas and it’s turning into a whole family drama.\n\nMy daughter “Sofia” (12) and her cousin “Martina” (6 - daughter of my sister “Maria” and her husband “Jose”) were gifted blind box Labubus as part of their Christmas gift from my other sister “Sara”. They each opened their boxes. Martina got a brown one and Sofia got a pink one. \n\nMartina immediately wanted the pink one and Sofia immediately offered a trade because she already has the pink one and was hoping for the brown one. They traded, both girls were happy, and that was that….or so I thought. \n\nLater, Martina’s parents found out from taking to someone that the brown Labubu is apparently a rare “secret” version that can sell for $250+. \n\nOnce they learned that, they called me said the girls needed to switch back and that Sofia was to return the brown one immediately. They even wanted me to drive over with it then and there despite the fact they live an hour away and it was already 8pm.\n\nI asked if Martina actually wanted the brown one back. They said that wasn’t the point. After some pushing back, Jose admitted someone was willing to pay him $225 for the Brown one and give Martina the pink one she wants.\n\nI said I wouldn’t force Sofia to swap back. From my perspective:\n\n* Both kids were happy with the trade and got the Labubu they wanted. \n* Sofia didn’t pressure or manipulate Martina into switching (if she had, I would have stepped in immediately and told her “you get what you get and you don’t get upset”). \n* When I asked her, Sofia admitted she knew the brown one was rare, but when I asked how much they sell for, she said they are blind boxes so you can’t buy the brown, they just make less of them. She didn’t know it was worth money. She’s not a good liar, and she appeared to be telling the truth. \n* Martina originally *didn’t* want the brown one and basically got upset when she saw Sofia got pink. \n* It feels like Maria and Jose only want the brown one back because they can sell it and pocket money from it.\n\nNow they’re upset with me and saying I’m being unfair and taking advantage of a 6-year-old and Jose even called Sofia a Manipulative B\\*\\*\\*h which I think is a reach when Sofia didn’t know it was worth a lot of money, she just knew they were rare to pull, that she already had the pink and Martina was crying for the pink one. \n\nSara has said this is “stupid parent drama” and she’s staying out of it and said we can sort it out ourselves. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to make my daughter give the brown Labubu back?\n\n**EDIT:** Jose called Sofia a Manipulative B\\*\\*\\*h to me on the phone discussing it, not to Sofia’s face. He’d be a dead man walking if he said it to her. It was said about an hour before making the post and I hung up on him for it and has not yet been addressed. My wife and I will obviously be addressing it, I was still processing it when I made the post, but the \"manipulative\" part made me wonder if I was being unreasonable, hence making the post.\n\n**EDIT 2:** since I can't reply now: Sofia is trying to collect the whole set of these Labubus, and her motivation for wanting the brown was to help complete the set. She has no intention of selling or trading it. After talking about it with her again, she took \"rare\" to mean it was simply harder to find in the boxes, she doesn't engage in buying/reselling. AFAIK Jose and Maria are not in desperate need of the cash.....they're not rich sure, but to the best of my knowledge, not in the kind of financial situation where the only way to keep the lights on for the next quarter is to sell their child's gift. We are in Australia - so this is in AUD.",

            "content": "I went to a Labubu tattoo event just now and there was a kid and her mom outside waiting with us talking about how they’d never gotten one and had been trying on PopNow/TTL for months. The girl was just excited to see mine IRL and talk about how badly she wanted one.\n\nThey were there before us, so we told them the person we were waiting to buy from was selling Labubus and could go first. While the girl’s mom was buying the one my friend wanted (which is fine - they were there first!) the little girl asked if she could pet the Labubu on my bag.\n\nI pulled Happiness out of my bag and asked if she wanted to hold it - there was my mistake LOL. The girl looks at me, her eyes well up with tears, and she yells “MOMMY, THIS LADY JUST GAVE ME HER LABUBU!!!”\n\nWhile her and her mom are hugging me and crying, my brain is trying to compute wtf just happened and figure out how to say I didn’t mean to give it to her and I’m kinda just like “😀 ahahahaha!” \n\nAll my friends keep asking me why I didn’t ask for it back but honestly who was I as a 26 year old to deny this very sweet 5 year old girl crying over a doll the doll she wanted. \n\nI’m still a little sad because my bf had gotten it for me, but honestly am so happy this little girl will have something to remember and love at her age. \n\nAT LEAST I STILL HAVE MY HAPPINESS LAFUFU AM I RIGHT (rip in peace happiness 😌✌🏻)",
