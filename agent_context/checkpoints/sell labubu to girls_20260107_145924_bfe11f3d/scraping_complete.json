      "title": "AITA for not making my daughter switch back a gifted Labubu with her younger cousin after her uncle found out the one my daughter gained in the swap is rare with a high resale value?",
      "desc": "Throwaway because family is on Reddit.\n\nThis happened over Christmas and it’s turning into a whole family drama.\n\nMy daughter “Sofia” (12) and her cousin “Martina” (6 - daughter of my sister “Maria” and her husband “Jose”) were gifted blind box Labubus as part of their Christmas gift from my other sister “Sara”. They each opened their boxes. Martina got a brown one and Sofia got a pink one. \n\nMartina immediately wanted the pink one and Sofia immediately offered a trade because she already has the pink one and was hoping for the brown one. They traded, both girls were happy, and that was that….or so I thought. \n\nLater, Martina’s parents found out from taking to someone that the brown Labubu is apparently a rare “secret” version that can sell for $250+. \n\nOnce they learned that, they called me said the girls needed to switch back and that Sofia was to return the brown one immediately. They even wanted me to drive over with it then and there despite the fact they live an hour away and it was already 8pm.\n\nI asked if Martina actually wanted the brown one back. They said that wasn’t the point. After some pushing back, Jose admitted someone was willing to pay him $225 for the Brown one and give Martina the pink one she wants.\n\nI said I wouldn’t force Sofia to swap back. From my perspective:\n\n* Both kids were happy with the trade and got the Labubu they wanted. \n* Sofia didn’t pressure or manipulate Martina into switching (if she had, I would have stepped in immediately and told her “you get what you get and you don’t get upset”). \n* When I asked her, Sofia admitted she knew the brown one was rare, but when I asked how much they sell for, she said they are blind boxes so you can’t buy the brown, they just make less of them. She didn’t know it was worth money. She’s not a good liar, and she appeared to be telling the truth. \n* Martina originally *didn’t* want the brown one and basically got upset when she saw Sofia got pink. \n* It feels like Maria and Jose only want the brown one back because they can sell it and pocket money from it.\n\nNow they’re upset with me and saying I’m being unfair and taking advantage of a 6-year-old and Jose even called Sofia a Manipulative B\\*\\*\\*h which I think is a reach when Sofia didn’t know it was worth a lot of money, she just knew they were rare to pull, that she already had the pink and Martina was crying for the pink one. \n\nSara has said this is “stupid parent drama” and she’s staying out of it and said we can sort it out ourselves. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to make my daughter give the brown Labubu back?\n\n**EDIT:** Jose called Sofia a Manipulative B\\*\\*\\*h to me on the phone discussing it, not to Sofia’s face. He’d be a dead man walking if he said it to her. It was said about an hour before making the post and I hung up on him for it and has not yet been addressed. My wife and I will obviously be addressing it, I was still processing it when I made the post, but the \"manipulative\" part made me wonder if I was being unreasonable, hence making the post.\n\n**EDIT 2:** since I can't reply now: Sofia is trying to collect the whole set of these Labubus, and her motivation for wanting the brown was to help complete the set. She has no intention of selling or trading it. After talking about it with her again, she took \"rare\" to mean it was simply harder to find in the boxes, she doesn't engage in buying/reselling. AFAIK Jose and Maria are not in desperate need of the cash.....they're not rich sure, but to the best of my knowledge, not in the kind of financial situation where the only way to keep the lights on for the next quarter is to sell their child's gift. We are in Australia - so this is in AUD.",

The girl was just excited to see mine IRL and talk about how badly she wanted one.\n\nThey were there before us, so we told them the person we were waiting to buy from was selling Labubus and could go first. While the girl’s mom was buying the one my friend wanted (which is fine - they were there first!) the little girl asked if she could pet the Labubu on my bag.\n\nI pulled Happiness out of my bag and asked if she wanted to hold it - there was my mistake LOL. The girl looks at me, her eyes well up with tears, and she yells “MOMMY, THIS LADY JUST GAVE ME HER LABUBU!!!”\n\nWhile her and her mom are hugging me and crying, my brain is trying to compute wtf just happened and figure out how to say I didn’t mean to give it to her and I’m kinda just like “😀 ahahahaha!” \n\nAll my friends keep asking me why I didn’t ask for it back but honestly who was I as a 26 year old to deny this very sweet 5 year old girl crying over a doll the doll she wanted. \n\nI’m still a little sad because my bf had gotten it for me, but honestly am so happy this little girl will have something to remember and love at her age. \n\nAT LEAST I STILL HAVE MY HAPPINESS LAFUFU AM I RIGHT (rip in peace happiness 😌✌🏻)",

I’m trying to focus on the (hopefully) positive aspects of the interaction - but also 10000% recognize and agree that enabling that kind of behavior and not clarifying doesn’t do anyone any good.\n\nI truly in my soul don’t feel like this was a scam situation - we had happened to run into the mom and the girl walking out of the arcade the event was in front of, and when they stopped to look at what was in their bags, I asked them if they were there for the Labubu event and struck up the convo. \n\nAll of that said, y’alls comments do make me realize that there are people out there without the same intentions I have. I try to lead my life with the phrase “assume positive intent” but CLEARLY this doesn’t always work for me, and was probably taken advantage of in this case :,) and I need to grow a pair!!!",

She pointed out my labubu hanging off my purse, ran up to me, held it, and observed how mine is wearing a turtle shell.  She said she has one but it's a la**fufu** (heavy emphasis on \"fufu\").  I'm just smiling and nodding at her and then she said, \"can I have it?\" while staring me down and suddenly having this death grip. I'm like, \"what?\" and gave her and her dad a look.  Her dad then quickly said \"oh, I'm sure this lady needs to get to where she's going\" to try and hurry his child away.\n\n[It very much felt like this ITYSL sketch in the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1GRckaQ_s).",

      "title": "Charli xcx Enters Her Next Chapter (Full Vanity Fair Interview)",
      "desc": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/charli-xcx-interview\n\nCharli xcx sheds the stage persona to talk to Anna Peele about her brand-new husband, their big fat Italian wedding (party), making nice with record execs, and the truth about her party girl image.\nBy Anna Peele\nOctober 14, 2025 \n\nCharli xcx is emoting more than seems possible for someone whose eyes—in public, at least—are nearly always conveying vacant disdain or covered by sunglasses. I arrived at her Hollywood Hills home, as requested, before 8 a.m.—an inconceivable meeting time for a person who loves to go out so much that she named one song for what she expects to hear when she’s partying (“Club Classics”) and another for the number of days a year she partakes in such activities (“365”). Throughout the conversation in her poolside courtyard, Charli rests on the lounge chair in every possible permutation of repose, from elbows on knees to partial recline to supine, and then supine the other way (another Charli banger: “360”).\n\nCharli is freshly showered, twisting her damp waves until a tumbleweed of hair falls to the ground and rolls across the patio. She is freckled (who knew Charli xcx had freckles?) and makeup-​free. (She is also bra-free, though that we have seen before.) Her ubiquitous Balenciaga and Mugler bags are elsewhere—she is wearing Bottega Veneta flats and a stomach-covering vintage T-shirt featuring three buxom women drawn by fetish artist Eric Stanton, as well as jeans by Guess, which are impossible to look at without triggering the lyrics of Charli’s song of the same name featuring Billie Eilish.\n\nGeorge Daniel, drummer for The 1975 and her husband of two weeks, keeps walking by with a beatific smile. Every time he does, Charli exclaims his name in excitement, as if she’s run into him somewhere she wasn’t expecting to rather than in their kitchen. “This is George,” she tells me delightedly, introducing us as he heads out for a hike with their rescue mutt, Nico, named for the singer. “Are you going to Runyon?” Charli asks about the hiking destination that is as well-trafficked in Los Angeles as the Erewhon smoothie line. No—George and Nico are headed to Bronson Caves. “Oh, cute!” Charli says. Everything to do with Daniel is cute. Soon they’ll be on a second wedding-cum-honeymoon in Italy. “It will be lovely,” Charli says. “Just eating mountains of pasta and drinking spritzes.”\n\nGeorge and Charli’s kitchen is open to the patio and features a truly enormous dining room table with bench seating. Taylor Marie Prendergast’s moody black-and-white art hangs on every wall, and a large easel holds a drawing of a tree that Charli sketched. The whole tableau is, right now, being blasted by morning sun from massive east-facing windows. I ask about the life events that made the purchase of this opulent home possible, and Charli openly wonders whether she can trust me enough to answer my questions.\n\nEarly hits like “Boom Clap” and “I Love It” were huge, but Charli wasn’t particularly. As she told Kareem Rahma on his interview series SubwayTakes last year before Brat came out, “Some artists have a song, but a song isn’t enough.” Charli says many friends have asked her, “You are in your 30s now—do you feel like you’re more equipped to handle this? What do you think would’ve happened if this had happened when you were 18?” But, Charli says, it kind of did happen—she was almost a plus-one to the world-famous songs she had created, which allowed her to travel and perform internationally and to engage with a kind of half version of what was to come. She was featured in publications like The Guardian and Rolling Stone, but the framing tended to focus on Charli’s permanent status in the waiting room of A-list-hood, where she was left to toil in niche brilliance. “I dipped my toe in, but I wasn’t fully in,” she says. “I think having that experience probably equipped me well for this happening.”\n\nSo now that brat is over…. Charli stops me as I put that to her. “I don’t really get to decide when it’s over or not,” she says. “I think that’s up to the world.” It will eventually exist “as a relic.” “I don’t think people will forget it,” she says. On the other hand, “It’s not fucking New Wave.”\n\n“The end will be interesting,” Charli says. “Because then I have to look at myself in a different way and be stripped of the thing that everyone identified me with.” Whatever this post-brat version of Charli xcx is, she says, “I won’t be staring into the abyss wondering what I’m gonna do.”\n\nAt least part of what she’s gonna do is turn into a movie star. Charli has seven films coming out soon, including three that debuted at the Toronto or Venice film festivals in September. There’s Erupcja, an indie film that emerged from her friendship with playwright Jeremy O. Harris and an unplanned meeting with director Pete Ohs at Clandestino. Charli also features in the fantasy 100 Nights of Hero, starring Emma Corrin, and the eco-satire Sacrifice, with Chris Evans and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nCharli will have a lead role in The Moment, distributed by A24, a revisionist history focused on the aftermath of Brat’s release in which she stars with Alexander Skarsgård. She is also writing songs for two major projects, including the Anne Hathaway–led pop idol epic Mother Mary.\n\nBut this is just the next moment. “I not only know that this won’t last forever,” Charli says. “I’m also really interested in the fact that it doesn’t.”\n\nWhen I ask how much more famous she feels when she’s in the wild now, Charli drops into the face she assumes out there. The chin lowers. The eyes die in a way that is profoundly withering. (“Hedonistic with the gravel drawl and dead eyes”—“Mean Girls.”) She uses her index fingers to pull her temple skin into a vulpine angle she normally achieves with tight, hidden braids. Her hair seems to get bigger.\n\n“Oh, my God,” I say. “That’s Charli.”\n\n“There it is,” she says, smiling again.\n\n“I’m always thinking about how I look and what I would change about my face,” Charli says, citing her favorite plastic surgery website RealSelf for giving her the resources to know that she can’t achieve a permanent version of the braid eye tilt with sugar threads. At some point, she says, she “probably will get” a mid-facelift. “I’m fucking thinking about all the shit that I could do and pull and stretch and morph on my face, all the time,” Charli says. “I have to just remind myself that maybe I can’t get too sucked into that.”\n\nShe recently stopped getting Botox. “I miss it,” she says mournfully. Her acting roles were what prompted the break from paralytic injectables. “I did a couple of audition tapes where I had Botox, and my eyebrows were doing that crazy thing when they kind of lift.” She drags up the outer edges to demonstrate the look, which evokes Jack Nicholson’s distinctive brows. “They look great on him,” Charli says.\n\nThe xcx persona embodied by the face is also a real facet of Charli’s life and personality that was first amplified long ago. “I see some analogy with someone like Dolly Parton, who is a performer, and you’re using that character. It is part of you, but there’s a little bit of that role-playing going on,” says Charli’s longtime collaborator A.G. Cook. At the same time, “It’s a very real version of Charli that is becoming more known,” Cook says.\n\nCharli grew up as a multiracial “frizzy-haired” little girl in Essex, near London. She is the only child of a white British entrepreneur and a Gujarati Indian flight attendant and nurse who came to the UK after her family was expelled from Uganda by the dictator Idi Amin. Charli’s parents supported her interest in the arts by taking the teenager to perform at illegal raves. She signed a deal with Asylum/Atlantic Records in 2009, half her life ago. Of Atlantic, Charli says, “It used to be quite a turbulent relationship, and now it’s just really not.” She partially attributes the shift at the label to the fact that “they used to really not like that I was kind of a bitch, and now I guess they know it can sell.”\n\nCharli is pleased that Atlantic does not demand she “collaborate creatively.” “I’m not open to feedback,” she says. “Like, that’s not what your job is. We can all pretend that it is, but it’s not.”\n\nI ask if she ever does just nod along and pretend their input is valuable simply to get through the meeting. “I don’t go to the meeting,” she says. Lest this make her seem rude, Charli clarifies, “I don’t wanna make it sound like the label are idiots. They’re definitely not. But I think it’s like, everybody has their strengths, right?” The label’s role: “They’re a bank,” she says. They advance Charli money to go off, do her thing with people she actually does want to collaborate creatively with, come back, tell them what and when the rollout is, and rent the tractor loader so she and Eilish can ride through a jillion bras and panties in the “Guess” music video. At this point, Charli says, “They want to just do that. They want to support the vision.” The vision is lucrative, after all.\n\n“We’re in a good place, and I wouldn’t swap it for anything,” Charli says, adding, “The devil you know.”\n\n“I don’t even think my driving factor has been, ‘I wanna be the biggest pop star ever in the world,’ or anything like that,” Charli says of her career goals. “I always just wanted to make music on my own terms and have as many people listen to it as possible, which sounds really simple. But I think I’ve really struggled over the years, because I’ve never felt like I fit in. Am I supposed to be this underground left artist, or am I supposed to try and be this commercial package? And I think before Brat, I just gave up on fighting with myself on that. I really said, ‘Okay, I am going to make this record in this specific way, and I’m actually fine with the consequences of that; if it means no one hears it, if it means I get dropped by my label.’ ” As we know, the consequence was Charli becoming one of the biggest pop stars in the world.\n\n“It’s fascinating to see how people ingest your personality and spit it back out—what people cling on to, what people miss,\" Charli says.\n\nIn April 2024, less than two months before the release of Brat, Charli and Troye Sivan announced they were co-headlining the Sweat tour, a six-week North American arena run. Last spring, Sivan was the bigger artist, promoting his album Something to Give Each Other. The single “Rush” was, in Sivan’s words, “popping off.” Charli told Sivan she was anxious she would negatively impact the tour. “I was worried that people would be like, ‘Oh no, who’s this girl preventing us from hearing “Rush”?’ ” she says. “Um, and then obviously, you know, things kinda changed for me.”\n\nOn June 7, Brat debuted. On June 27, Charli made a surprise appearance at Sivan’s solo London show. He had the idea that the stage should go black, then turn the sickly color of the album cover, then Charli would appear in silhouette.\n\n“The sound that came out of the crowd when she appeared with the wind in her hair and the Brat green background behind her…. It was a completely overwhelming response,” Sivan says. “I get chills thinking about it now.” He was thrilled as a friend but also as a fan. “I am so happy to be a part of the community of gays that have been following her for so long,” Sivan says. Charli reciprocates the devotion; she says she feels “super indebted to” her queer fans.\n\n“She’s been our queen for a really long time,” says Sivan. “I feel very honored to get to represent the gays that have died for her for forever.”\n\nCharli is a completist when it comes to seeking out people’s opinions about herself, from the gays that die for her to journalists. She told me she reads every bit of coverage about herself—that the social media climate affects her. She wants to know how people discuss her, how critics perceive her, what the newer listeners make of all of this. “It’s fascinating to see how people ingest your personality and spit it back out—what people cling on to, what people miss,” Charli says. “I’m always interested in, like, what does the casual viewer think? And they probably think I’m a girl who parties and does drugs and is a little bit bitchy.”\n\nSo is “365” a commentary on people’s perception of her? “No, I am saying, ‘I’m a 365 party girl,’ ” Charli says. “ ‘365’ is a song about going to a party, feeling yourself, feeling really hot, but essentially getting really crazy because you’re running away from something. Then, as the song progresses, everything gets a little wilder and more fucked up sonically as the person is getting more wild and fucked up. And by the end of it, it’s kind of sad.”\n\nThe 365 party girl is definitely not fucked up right now, just fucking exhausted. A few days ago, Charli celebrated turning 33 by the same pool we’re sitting beside. It was a sedate affair that also fêted her best friend and interior designer, Georgia May Somary, who had a birthday around the same time. Charli needed a break from all the more standard partying she’s done in the past year or so, including her 32nd birthday, attended by Eilish, Taylor-Joy, Glen Powell, Lorde, Addison Rae, and Rosalía, who brought a bouquet of Parliament cigarettes for the honoree. “It was perfect,” Charli says. “It was just one of those classically LA nights where word of mouth spreads and then people just come. I think a lot of people felt that it was performative or something, but I think maybe they were just mad they weren’t there.” Charli smirks. “What can I say? When all my friends are drunk, they like posing for photos.”\n\n“If enough people say that it is true on the internet, it becomes the truth,” Charli says of all the misperceptions about her. I ask why she doesn’t correct the record. “You can’t,” she says—that just makes it bigger. “Fact-checking is dead,” Charli tells me, which will come as a surprise to Vanity Fair’s research department. She says doing this cover story and being vulnerable and open while imagining what, say, the Daily Mail will aggregate from it is scary, even though the theoretical concept of how information is decontextualized fascinates her. “I have a big mouth, and I say shit and sometimes it gets me in trouble,” Charli says. “You seem lovely. But were you trying to get me on your side, so I would reveal more? I don’t know.”\n\nCharli appeared on the podcast Las Culturistas two days before Brat debuted. During the interview, she wavered about whether she would reveal who the album’s songs were about. “My thing is, people are gonna guess,” she told hosts Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers before declining to name the inspiration for “Girl, So Confusing,” about a complicated relationship with another female musician who has similar hair to Charli’s. “I think you probably both have an accurate guess,” Charli said. “It’s probably that person.” (It was Lorde, who likely would have remained anonymous if she hadn’t accepted Charli’s invitation to “work it out on the remix.”) It felt like—or at least practically functioned as—the moment when Charli decided to let Brat speak for itself. “Exactly,” Charli’s frequent collaborator Aidan Zamiri confirms of her choice to not explicate songs that dropped enough hints to be fairly explicit to fans paying close attention though remained inscrutable (but googleable) to the casual viewer who’s only aware she’s a little bit bitchy. “Charli is very instinctive about how she wants to share information, and I liked that one of the things she said about the album is that she tried to not lean into metaphor,” Zamiri says.\n\nWith the exception of the omnipresent Julia Fox (“I’m so Julia”—“360”) and Lorde, Charli has mostly left it up to the internet to imagine the truth about the subjects of her music.\n\nA New York magazine writer tried to get Charli to discuss whether “Sympathy Is a Knife” is about Taylor Swift, as was a common interpretation of lyrics that mentioned dreading seeing someone backstage at her boyfriend’s show. (In 2023, Swift dated Daniel’s 1975 bandmate Matty Healy, who would subsequently crowd-surf at Charli and Daniel’s Italian wedding redux.) The song features a momentary fit of resentment in the chorus:\n\nCause I couldn’t even be her if I tried\n\nI’m opposite, I’m on the other side\n\nI feel all these feelings I can’t control\n\nAll this sympathy is just a knife\n\n“You do the silence game,” Charli told the magazine, refusing to acquiesce to a discussion about whether she’d thought of leaving out a particularly revealing line. “But I know that well—where you go silent and want me to talk more. But I don’t care about it being awkward. We’ll sit in silence.”\n\n“I feel like my problem with a lot of musician documentaries is it often shows the musician coming up against some kind of opposition and eventually overcoming it to be the hero,” Charli says. “And that's just not been my experience, you know?”\n\n“I think I’m just quite direct and blunt,” Charli tells me when I ask about that moment and talk about how different it feels from how warm she’s been today. “I hate this phrase, but what you see is what you get with me. People think it’s all some kind of performance, but it’s not. I’m not sat here talking to you being the way that I am onstage. But I think there is a correlation in that there’s a messiness and a lack of perfection. It’s the combination of talking about those things whilst also embracing them and really struggling with them is what makes me whole. And I think that it makes me honest. You can vouch for me, I hope.”\n\nI tell her I can’t fact-check her heart, but my impression is that Charli is incredibly sincere.\n\n“Or I’m a psychopath,” she says, cackling.\n\nIn October, Swift released The Life of a Showgirl, featuring “Actually Romantic,” which appeared to misinterpret Charli's song about self-doubt as a diss track, with lyrics like, “I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave,” and, \"Wrote me a song sayin' it makes you sick to see my face.\" Swift has not confirmed who “Actually Romantic” is about, beyond saying it's someone who had a “one-sided, adversarial relationship with” her. (If you write an adversarial track about someone, is the relationship really one-sided?) Pretty much everyone immediately believed the song was about Charli; Swifties swarmed.\n\nSince the Showgirl drop, Charli hasn’t exactly been in witness protection, popping up on the Saturday Night Live stage to support musical guest Role Model, anointing him with her signature sunglasses. The saga continues in the comments section, but so far Charli has avoided engaging directly, including in the pages of Vanity Fair. She declined to comment on the situation.\n\nLast September, in the middle of the Sweat tour and right before the Brat 2024 Arena Tour, Charli sent Zamiri a message; or, as he describes it, “word vomit.” Zamiri had worked with Charli directing the “Guess” and “360” videos, the latter featuring an It girl theme embodied by guest stars including Fox, YouTube star Emma Chamberlain, model (and Healy’s fiancée) Gabbriette, actors Hari Nef and Rachel Sennott, and proto It girl Chloë Sevigny. “It almost felt like a diary entry of, ‘This is how I feel right now,’ ” Zamiri says of Charli’s message. “This feeling of having just almost got everything she could have wanted, and what that felt like on kind of a human level.”\n\nThe document became the genesis for The Moment. Zamiri and Bertie Brandes finished the screenplay in a few months with input from Charli, and Zamiri filmed it last spring. “I really don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who works as hard as Charli does,” Sivan says, noting that in between Sweat dates, Charli would take on roles in movies, including Gregg Araki’s I Want Your Sex, in which Araki says Charli does a “top-notch” American accent and nailed a scene in which “she’s faking an orgasm with Cooper Hoffman’s character.” What was Sivan doing during his downtime? “Resting,” he says.\n\nOne project Charli turned down during this period was a tour documentary. She felt the market was already saturated with similar projects and says, “I feel like my problem with a lot of musician documentaries is it often shows the musician coming up against some kind of opposition and eventually overcoming it to be the hero. And that’s just not been my experience, you know? Maybe it has been a lot of other people’s, and that’s awesome.”\n\nCharli calls The Moment “a 2024 period piece.” “It’s not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one,” she says. “It’s fiction, but it’s the realest depiction of the music industry that I’ve ever seen.”\n\nAlexander Skarsgård, who stars in Charli's forthcoming film The Moment, was blown away by her stage persona. “The second she steps offstage, she sheds that part of her personality,” he says. “Then she’s back to being this sweet little Charli.”\n\nAsked to describe his role, Skarsgård says he plays someone whom “the record label convinces Charli is the hottest director out there at the moment; the right person to capture the essence of Charli xcx and get the most out of this phenomenon that brat was.”\n\nDirector Zamiri calls Skarsgård’s character “one of the villains or antagonists of the film.” (Charli herself may be another one; she describes her role as “sort of a hell version of myself.”) Zamiri is cagier about the plot, saying only that the film explores what would have happened if Charli had made “entirely different choices” around brat. (As far as we know, in this counterfactual, Charli’s viral X post “kamala IS brat” still does not make Harris win the presidential election against Donald Trump. At least, as Charli told Zane Lowe, she’s “obviously happy to be on the right side of history.”)\n\nThe Moment features a score by Cook. Skarsgård did not reveal to Charli until after they’d wrapped that she was his second most-played artist on Spotify in 2024. (The first was a Japanese pop star from the 1970s and ’80s named Eiichi Ohtaki, which Skarsgård concedes is a very brat choice.) He has just seen Charli perform for the first time at a music festival in Gothenburg, Sweden, a few days before we speak and says, “I got to see the snippets of that when we shot the movie. But the other night when I got to see the full show, it was really remarkable how the second she steps offstage, she sheds that part of her personality. Then she’s back to being this sweet little Charli.”\n\nCharli views making The Moment as an almost therapeutic exercise. “I always find it hard to sit down and look at things with distance, because I am always moving on to the next thing,” she says. “I think that I process myself through my work. I’m writing about myself and my thoughts all the time, and my thoughts about what people think about me.” Charli gestures toward infinity with a Queen Elizabeth wave. “The meta-ness continues.”\n\nThe obvious follow-up to Brat would have been to make more music, as Charli had done after her previous five studio albums—especially now that there was the option that, as she says, “You could just do more of that thing because now that’s what people see you as. You’ve solidified this brand that people seem to understand and want to digest very easily.” That was not particularly inspiring to Charli. And also, as she’d word-vomited to Zamiri, she’d basically gotten everything she wanted.\n\n“Did I need everyone’s validation to feel that way?” Charli asks of her secondhand self-acceptance. “I guess I probably did, and that’s probably why I am an artist. But I think once I had that experience, that’s reward enough for me to feel satisfied in that area for a while.” Twenty minutes later, her zen has evaporated somewhat. “I don’t think one day I’m gonna wake up and be like, ‘I feel confident, and I’m done with feeling anything else other than confidence,’ ” Charli says. “Some days I feel totally destroyed and completely in the depths of misery. But I also need the high contrast to be able to create anything. If I was happy all the time, I probably wouldn’t be making art.”\n\nWhile Charli says she doesn’t know if or when she’ll release another album, she’s already been working on more music, albeit for a fictional character. She and Jack Antonoff wrote songs for Mother Mary, the David Lowery film in which Anne Hathaway plays a famous musician. “We were making music that I don’t think I would ever make for my artist project”—songs for Charli xcx—“but still music that I truly love.”\n\nIn addition to contributing music for Hathaway’s character, Charli told her (at her request) what being a pop star is like. She was “so generous sharing her experiences,” Hathaway says. “It was like chatting with a girlfriend.”\n\n“She was the opposite of aloof,” Hathaway says. “I was delighted at how friendly and real she was. Her talent is one that’s easily underappreciated because the end result feels so fun and achievable, but it’s actually a stunningly rare feat.”\n\nAs Charli revises history in The Moment, a major difference between the film and real life is that there is no George Daniel character.\n\nOvercompensating creator and star Benito Skinner met Charli at a party at Cara Delevingne’s house. He and his boyfriend Terry O’Connor, who subsequently collaborated with Charli on the look and rollout of Brat (and the Kamala Harris post), became close with her and Daniel. “If you don’t believe in love or straight relationships, which I usually don’t, I believe in this one,” Skinner says. Before a 1975 show at Hollywood Bowl, Charli got glam to be in the audience because, she told Skinner, “I’m hot girlfriend tonight.” At Coachella, Skinner stood with Daniel while Charli performed. “I just watched him watch her,” Skinner says. “It was so sweet. He just had his Aperol spritz, and that’s his queen.”\n\nCharli and Daniel got married in London’s Hackney district in late July. The planning wasn’t painstaking; they just happened to have time in their schedules and made it work. Charli didn’t get her Vivienne Westwood dress until five days before the ceremony.\n\n“It’s cool to be married,” Charli says in a tone that would also be appropriate for talking about an interestingly shaped rock. “I never really saw it for myself, to be honest.” Her own parents didn’t wed until she was 16. “I think one day they were, like, feeling it,” she says. “And I think that’s so sweet.”\n\n“It was cool to feel so in love, and do it our way,” Charli says, now ceding a bit of gushiness to her husband. “We both kind of just wanted to not feel the pressures of the things you’re supposed to feel when you get married.”\n\nCharli did not want to feel, she says, like “this is the day of your life as a woman. I’m like, it’s actually just another cool day.” They woke up, had breakfast at Allpress in Dalston, “and then we just went and did it,” Charli says. “It was cute. He’s the best.” While she does not mention his less flattering angles—and, based on everyone I talked with, he doesn’t seem to have many—Charli says, “He really understands who I am at my best and at my worst.”\n\n“When he’s deep within making a 1975 record and needs perspective, we can talk about it, and vice versa,” Charli says. “It feels very calming to have that. Sometimes, you have to really grapple with fear and expectation and it being over.”\n\nWhen I talk to Charli a few weeks later, right after the Brat tour is over, she has already moved on to the next thing, which she acknowledges “is probably some kind of a protection defense mechanism from having to sit and feel the empty space of the silence between creative projects.”\n\nCharli launches into describing her next enterprise: writing songs for Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Wuthering Heights, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. “That’s the world I’ve been living in,” Charli says. Despite the internet’s apparent horror at the idea that the film might feature pop music anachronistic to the largely 18th-century setting—someone posted that it was like the “matcha dubai chocolate labubu of film”—she tells me it’s an “elegant and brutal sound palette…. It couldn’t be more different from Brat.”\n\nThe end of that sentence could apply to Charli’s entire shift to film, which has bled even into her social media. In addition to her many acting roles, Charli has cultivated an amusing cinephilic presence on the movie review site Letterboxd under the handle itscharlibb, where she chronicles her personal consumption and, occasionally, the status of her projects. (Sample review, of Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth: “watched this whilst george built lego ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ .”)\n\n“I saw the film Phantom Thread,” Charli says of the Paul Thomas Anderson film about the self-inflicted tortures of being an artistic genius. The main character, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, only steps away from his work when he’s sick, so his wife deliberately gives him toxic mushrooms so he can take breaks and they have time to connect. (It’s actually a really nice relationship.) “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, that’s so me,’ ” Charli says. “When I get sick, George nurses me back to health, and that’s when I feel calm.” She adds, “But he doesn’t poison me.” (There’s no way for me to fact-check!) Charli says she can only rest when her body shuts down and tells her, “No, Charli, you must stop.” “Life’s so short,” she says. “There’s so much I want to do. I want to just constantly be doing it.”\n\nPhotographed exclusively for VF by Aidan Zamiri in Los Angeles. Sittings Editor Max Ortega. Hair products by Bumble and Bumble.

      "desc": "I was one of the people who tuned in every show when they were on nearly every day. It felt like a girls' hangout, with fun clothes. It was embarrassing how many packages I had every week. \n\nSo much has changed. I rarely watch anymore because the streams are soulless and sad, There is no more music, (well.... there are quíet blips you can't hear). A weird direction from the banger playlists. I used to add so much new music to my daily drive from Emily and Shoddy days.\n\nThey aren't even selling Doll's Kill brands! Earlier today the really cool host with colorful hair was selling plush animal backpacks but they were just like generic toys. I've also seen counterfeit Labubu pillows and bags for sale in their stream. Later on I popped back in and this host (who wasn't even wearing Dolls Kill clothes, which was weird) kept showing off-brand cheap stuff. I stuck around for maybe twenty minutes and she didn't even really interact, just change out the hanger after each auction and say the next size. \n\nThe large TVs used to be awesome, anyone remember seeing Shrek boogie and twerk on repeat? Or pretty girly screensavers when Helena was on? It was another element that made the whole thing so interesting.\n\nHere is a screenshot from earlier today. Everything is drab and empty, the camera isn't even straight. \n\nMaybe it was just the perfect storm of mixed personalities when they started, and it hasn't been able to be replicated since those personalities have left, one by one. \n\nCan anyone suggest any Whatnot sellers that have the magic and style of the golden era that I might like? Honestly about to just delete the app. The only reason I joined was to shop Dolls Kill. ",

They only go live a handful of times a month but they are a costume shop in New Orleans and they are bright, colorful, wacky and so much fun to watch.

I stopped watching as much when they discontinued plus sizes but was always there for shoes. Then I got to the point where I owned all of the shoes (I have a problem!!!!) so tuned in even less frequently. Now I don't even know who the hosts are and checking it out just now ... It's so generic. 💔💔\n\nDid anyone find out if there is truth to the bankruptcy rumor? Maybe they don't even have stock anymore so that's why they are selling weird garage sale crap.",

They sold and/or downsized their warehouse because they use 3rd party fulfillment (Shopify Warehouses). This means they no longer have clothes and endless supply at their disposal as the live shows used to stream from one of their places — which is now used as a Dave & Busters. \n\nWhen the hosts used to talk about their stock, they’d mention the warehouses were sending over huge Gaylord’s (giant palette sized shipping boxes) of clothes, shoes, etc.. It slowly started where they weren’t able to do shoe days, weren’t able to do plus days, weren’t able to do as many shows… The stock slowed down because they pedaled over a thousand items a day, which was their goal as the hosts mentioned. \n\nSam left, Fini left - to become designer assistant (she now no longer works there), Emery left, Lilo left (unless it’s special shows), Xtina left, and Preston left. \n\nAlso a side note before Fini left her designer role (my favorite host btw), I figured she was let go but was told she actually QUIT because they gave her like an hour or shift of work a week.",

Like if you don’t agree with what everyone in the chat is saying then you IMMEDIATELY get dogged and it’s weird. Like there was a convo abt falling in reverse once n people were doggin on others for not liking them even though all the recent controversy they’ve been in- like Sorry not everyone has to enjoy a transphobic gf beaters music?? So fucking weird\n      Also hate the catering to resellers, like them outwardly saying “oh guys don’t let it go for a steal, you can always resell it” like 🧍‍♂️the amount of times I’ve been outbid on something or seen others get outbid just to see the person who bought it reselling it a week later for double/triple the price they got it is so annoying OR just saying str8 up in the chat that  they’re gonna resell it right after they win it like😐 “oH wElL iF yOu gUyS wanT iT, bOoKmaRk mY uPcomInG shOw oR gO tO mY deFLoP” like ew no- and GOD FORBID you say that’s lame cuz then the chat starts jumping you.

The inevitable end is near, it's just a really long slowburn. They knew it going in to it, but they take the chance to see how long they can keep people dazzled with. the psychological manipulation that we refer to as \"marketing\" to sell their microplastics made from fossil fuels, stolen art, and slavery. \n\nThey call us \"bestie,\" \"baddie,\" and \"babe\" every day after we give them our phone number and email for discount codes, creating some parasocial relationship to keep us chained and loyal to a soulless corporation. They post content living lives we could only dream of being in, having loads of money from the payment plans we had to use to get our hauls to fill the voids we have from our burnout from being overworked, underpaid, waved off by society, etc. \n\nBut maybe the outfit will be cute in the photos for my post and I'll get enough likes for enough validation to make up for the love and compassion I won't give myself and the world can't afford anyone else either. PLUR and fun live streams though! \n\nHaha, sorry to be a drag, but it is a hard pill to swallow when you realize you've been used for your money and attention by some company who steps on the necks of others to accumulate wealth while you're just accumulating stuff and hoarding plastic clothes and...junk and likely debt.",

      "title": "KATSEYE is KPOP, there's nothing not-kpop about them",
      "desc": "I've been watching KATSEYE's rollout with cautious interest, but at this point it’s becoming clear: they don’t know who they are musically, and worse - they’re not even trying to define it.\n\nLet’s talk about it.\n\nI’ve been trying to give KATSEYE a fair chance, but I can’t help feeling like they’re the perfect example of everything hollow about current idol pop branding from Korean labels. Especially when it comes to debut groups manufactured for international markets, KATSEYE falls short on originality and authenticity.\n\nThe music videos are OVER THE TOP. Like very Sabrina Carpenter. They're all fighting each other. Great. Cool to watch. Engaging. But then I realized. Take away the music videos, where do they stand?\n\nLet’s be honest - SIS was basic. Felt really generic and \"Touch\" sounded like an ILLIT song. Their recent comebacks was sub-par. \"GNARLY\" was not it and I don't know why that abomination exists. Was a huge letdown for me. \"Gabriela\" is MID. It sounds stale, very 2016 and some kind of lounge music (there's nothing that stands out), could be playing in the background and no one will notice. Maybe its because it's just a B-side. Ok. I give them a pass.\n\nNow, we all know they're styled like a K-pop group, move like one, dance like one... but somehow they’re adamant about not being called one? The irony is hilarious. They're literally using the K-pop industry’s infrastructure, style, and fan marketing strategy, while publicly distancing themselves from the label.  They already have a MAMA award (Asian award show), what next? Golden Disc award?  K-drama OST? Yoo Jae Suk Running Man appearance? Lee Mujin service? Korean University College festival performances?  Lightsticks, photocards and fanchants?  😂\n\nI mean, I don't mind them getting all this success, but come on. NO \"global group\" gets easy pass like them. They have majority of listeners coming from K-pop bubble. So please. You can’t eat the cake and pretend you’re gluten-free 🤷 It's like learning the Asian Cuisine of making noodles but selling them as \"Global\" cuisine - It's still noodles!!\n\nSo far, every rollout feels like a dress-up session rather than a musical statement. New teaser? New look. New \"concept\"? New wardrobe. And I see people flaunting it as \"versatile\". Uhmm...no. It looks like they're lost and are trying everything for that 5 minutes of fame - a short trend that will die down. Like Labubu or Stanley cup. One more over-the-top music video and a mid song and I can see people realizing this sham. None of what they do have come together to say who they are as artists to me.   \n It’s like someone dumped a mood board into a blender and hit “aesthetic.” We don’t know if they’re going for edgy, dreamy, bratty, experimental, or viral-friendly - we just know they want to look like they’re all of them. \n\n# More Entertainers than a Musical Group \n\nI can't help but see that this group is gaining traction bc people like to be entertained - they are great performers, they give off attitude and expressions during their lipsynced performances (again, a K-pop thing 😉) It's nice to watch them. Engaging. Entertaining. Its also nice to know about the LGBTQ+ members. Cool. Everyone's gay - no I mean, I'm happy for them 😁 but one more person comes out in that group, I will start having doubts about queerbaiting 😬 But anyways, I don't care about their sexuality, Pass. Let's talk about music.\n\n# No Artistic Spine\n\nThere’s zero musical throughline. The songs feel like they were designed for tiktok attention spans - literally 2 minutes long, mostly hook, barely any vocal line distribution, and forgettable lyrics. What happened to bridges? Builds? Emotion?\n\nThis doesn’t feel like a group being introduced - it feels like a brand activation. A clear aim at \"popculture\" trend, meme, virality. For the gays and the gals.  Sometimes the group reminds of a University pamphlet  showcasing \"diversity\" (lmao, just kidding 😅)\n\nWhat’s wild to me is that KATSEYE’s whole project is clearly rooted in K-pop machinery:\n\nTrained in Korea\n\nStyled by K-pop veterans\n\nPromoted using fan engagement methods straight out of the K-pop playbook\n\nHas Korean PD-nims. (I've watched all their content, and I can see they have traditional K-pop staff and PD-nims behind the scenes. Yoonchae is a part time translator)\n\nBut suddenly the language changes when it’s time to go global. “Not a K-pop group.” Why? Are they trying to distance themselves to appeal to a Western market that’s still weird about foreign language music? It feels cowardly - like they want all the structure of K-pop without being held accountable to its standard of excellence. I mean if \"Golden\" by Jung Kook - a pop album is categorized as K-pop, then GNARLY is clearly K-pop, bc of how experimental it sounds. It reminded me of badly produced half-baked NCT song (that will never exist) when I first heard it.\n\nTL;DR :  \n\nKATSEYE doesn’t feel like a musical group - it feels like a concept simulator wrapped in K-pop packaging with none of the depth. No vocal moments, no artistic stance, just short-form content designed for virality, not longevity. And yes, the upcoming EP; The 12 minutes 🫠 \"EP\" clearly curated for the streams and charts (a HYBE signature atp). They’re skimming from the top of the K-pop iceberg, hoping aesthetics + Tiktok = success. But global audiences are smart - and more and more groups (like XG, FLO, Citizen Queen, no na) are showing what it actually means to have identity, intention, and artistry.  \nTheir fans just wanna gaslight themselves to think \"they're not like other groups\". THEY'RE THE SAME.  You wanna believe some made up stuff the members say for PR move and think its all the truth.\n\nThey feel like the fast fashion version of a girl group - entertaining on the outside and meme-worthy on the inside, but disposable at the core.\n\n",

          "content": "Exactly, it still has all of the parasocial wants a kpop fan trapped in a cult wants, but at least , maybe, they can make them laugh. I think katseye fans are still blinded by their weird love for every Asian person they see…(Not EVERY, but you know which ones). I occasionally check up on the katseye group to see how it’s going, and I see something about how much each member “owned their era” I think it was about their new song ‘Game Boy’. The song isn’t my cup of tea, and the music video was plain.\n\nHowever, it was very obvious, Manon? I believe did a very good job and definitely did the best for the music video, she had a solo, the whole thing was practically centered around her…But some how, Yoonchae was the only person who caught your eye? Now, people can like who they want, and of course, I don’t hate Yoonchae, I love every one from every race, but knowing kpop fans, they only notice her so much because she’s Korean. And they have an odd love for Korean people. \n\nYoonchae did fine in the music video, but it was nothing outstanding, normal performance, but the entire Music video was being “owned” by Manon. I think that was pretty obvious. Now, I might be looking a bit to into it? They always seem to do this with Yoonchae, she’s 17, almost an adult, but they treat her like a little baby, just like how they usually treat Koreans in regular kpop groups. They also have to bring her up in every video, every, single, time. “Yoonchae is so cute” , or “Yoonchae is the cutest”. And I’m not saying you can’t have favorites, but it very much is racially motivated. Or I’m looking too deep into it. \n\nI had to say this because I was thinking about Katesye last night, happy you made this post. People need to stop thinking Katesye is a global group. They also treat Lara with horrible respect, and honestly treat Sophia like she barely exists, not as bad though. And this is because they aren’t the “perfect” Asians they want. It’s so ridiculous.",

They definitely get a lot of influence from y2k era and are trying to have this big pop niche but it has already been done countless times. it’s just kinda seems out of touch. Love to them tho but management needs to understand they can’t take bits and piece from already established peoples brand and put them together to make this groups songs, mvs, and choreography ",

But it was manufactures out of talented people who trained for years in those skills. This on the other hand felt like a netflix reality show first with the by product of getting to release music because ‘you made it’ till the end.",

No star quality whatsoever. And copying the y2k era isn't going to do jack shit for them.

Here's some pieces of media which promote korea as heaven and then 13 yr old girls will shove it down your throat.\"  \nWhatever speaking, 2025 has been a not very good year.  \nLike we have:  \nLabubu Dolls  \nGrow A Garden  \nTung Tung Sahur  \nItalian Brainrot  \nAI Music  \nand now a lazy crash-grab KPOP movie which is like \"anime but also not\" type shit.\n\nNot very detailed rant, but you get what I mean.  \nPeace out  \nXD",

I have made better AI music, but I also use professional tools and not just AI to write my music. I can't stand generic AI music that people just don't put any effort into and let the system write everything for them we have too much of it, It's a shame because people who can actually write and make good music when they also use AI as a TOOL ONLY  get the bad end of this too which isn't fair. I am very confident in my music. I've been writing since 1995, elementary school years.. I am also in school for audio production so I know a thing or two. \n\n\n And those little bu-bu things  hideous abominations!. I hate them. I honestly don't understand the hype. \n\n\nMy kids used to play grow a garden, it's strange that it got so popular for such a simple game but it might have to do with popular streamers or something I really don't know. ",

      "title": "Half the women saying they ‘don’t like men’ are just scared of losing approval from other women.",
      "desc": "Most of what you see online and this sub isn’t based in reality. It’s noise feeding on itself. The recent article about women being “embarrassed by their boyfriends” shows it perfectly. It isn’t about men at all; it’s about how many women have become captive to the approval of other women. They’re not embarrassed by their boyfriends. They’re embarrassed that other women (online) might not find them impressive enough.\n\nWhen validation turns into a belief system, authenticity disappears. You end up with women who secretly want connection performing disdain for men so the hive mind won’t exile them. It isn’t empowerment. It’s performance art for an audience that rewards cynicism and punishes honesty. The tragedy is that what’s presented as confidence is really conformity wearing a feminist mask.\n\nThat same collective instinct drives nearly every aspect of online beauty culture. Scroll through Instagram or TikTok and everyone starts to blur together: the same contouring, the same lips, the same lashes, the same filters. The “clean girl,” “baddie,” and “soft girl” trends might rotate, but the faces all look nearly identical. It’s manufactured uniqueness that ends up looking like cloning by ring light. What’s sold as self-expression has turned into mass production, each person copying the last in the name of individuality.\n\nThis aesthetic uniformity also explains why so many women claim to find other women more attractive than men. What they’re responding to isn’t genuine difference or individuality; it’s standardization. The women they see online have all been molded by the same algorithmic template: smooth skin, sculpted features, perfect lighting, and filtered perfection. It’s not natural admiration. It’s recognition of a perfected, conformist version of femininity that social media has trained everyone to see as desirable.\n\nThe same is true for fashion and cosmetic surgery. McKinsey’s State of Fashion 2024 notes that micro-trends now rise and die in less than three months, and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reports double-digit growth in cosmetic procedures each year. Add influencer marketing and you get a perfect storm of conformity. The makeup, the outfits, the poses, the filters, it’s all a uniform worn to signal belonging rather than individuality. And this same logic now fuels how people spend money.\n\nA majority of trendy mainstream purchases are overpriced, marketed toward younger audiences, and built around collecting through constant buying. Designer handbags that cost as much as a car and collectible toys like Labubu that sell out in minutes are symptoms of the same sickness. None of it serves a real purpose beyond signaling status inside a social bubble. The marketing plays on the same psychology used to sell toys to children: scarcity, novelty, and peer approval. It’s consumer infantilization wrapped in luxury packaging. Buying becomes belonging, and belonging demands endless consumption.\n\nThat pressure to conform doesn’t stop at appearance or spending. It bleeds into behavior. Detachment itself has become fashionable. Saying you don’t like men is the new way to signal that you’re part of the in-crowd. It’s not independence; it’s branding, another layer of identity curated for the algorithm. The same hive mind that dictates the contour of your cheekbones now dictates your opinions. The “cool kids” aren’t classmates anymore; they’re influencers and strangers deciding what emotions are socially acceptable.\n\nMen have their own echo chambers of course, but theirs usually form around activities and shared goals instead of image replication. The female hive mind online has become consumption-based, a constant loop of buying, posing, and posting dressed up as liberation. And beneath all the filters and slogans, most of these women would probably be happier being honest about what they actually want. But honesty doesn’t trend, and vulnerability doesn’t sell. So the performance continues, endless confidence posts hiding quiet insecurity, all for the approval of people who aren’t even watching for long.\n\nIf that offends you and you feel the urge to call me a misogynist for saying what’s obvious to anyone outside the noise, that’s fine. I don’t need your validation, and I promise I’ll sleep just fine without your upvote.\n",

          "content": "As a woman, I agree that a lot of what women are saying and doing online, including a lot of the misandrist speech, is to fit in and not to express their actual thoughts and desires. (I can't speak to whatever happens in bars or clubs as I haven't really gone to those much.) I grew up homeschooled and isolated so a lot of these trends are foreign to me, and trying to conform would be like putting lipstick on a pig. In real life I have a track record of getting along best with women ten or twenty years older than me, because they don't expect me to be the same as them.\n\nEven for women who *do* talk about being attracted to men, you can tell that they feel there's safety in a trend. You can look at forums like r/AskRedditAfterDark and see the trends that have trickled down from TikTok or Instagram - like apparently it's a thing right now to be attracted to men in gray sweatpants, or backwards baseball caps, or (weirdest of all to me) horror-movie masks, specifically the Ghostface mask. And a lot of them want a \"dom\" and claim their favorite thing is to feel pain and be degraded in bed. I've finally accepted that some women are actually sincere about that, I've read the studies and explanations, but it's so foreign to the way I personally experience desire that I can't help but think a lot of them are jumping on a trend, especially since I didn't see so much of this talk until a few years ago.\n\nThe trends among women and girls I saw on the Internet when I started being online 10-12 years ago were different - fewer women said they wanted a man to be a \"dom,\" for instance. There was that little comic that went viral saying that if Batman were drawn for the \"female gaze\" he would be a pretty boy with big eyes and kissable lips. Among fanfiction-writing nerd girls it was common to have a fetish for (their idea of) gay male relationships. Since the trends in female expressions of desire ten years ago were (mostly) somewhat closer to my own private teenage feelings, I didn't realize they were trends at first. But I think some women must have been performative about wanting a soft man, the way some women must be performative about wanting a \"dom\" nowadays, or performative about hating men and thinking they're all trash.\n\nI'm sometimes reading radical feminist or 4B forums (I read all kinds of weird forums out of curiosity - probably a bad use of my time, but oh well), and they have a big issue of women *saying* all the 4B stuff (basically, \"Never connect with or depend on a man\") but still actually dating and marrying men lol. It is hard for women in general to really stay away from men. At least in their thoughts and feelings. A lot of us, like a lot of men, basically live on the Internet now and sate their desire for men through illusory online means, celebrity crushes or erotic novels or AI boyfriends, because many people nowadays are too cowardly to talk to real people with the real complications and consequences that reality can bring.",

Men would very gladly go against the world, and definitely care more about the women than what the world thinks of them. Most men are like- \"if a woman likes me, I give zero fucks what anyone else thinks\". It's that fundamental biological and psychological difference (the mind and body are one thing) that leads to the claim that women don't 'like' men, because like is a strong word that implies a strong, robust, and 'real' affinity that can endure fickle and shifting social trends, which are often the least difficult of the challenges a person has to face at an individual level and as part of a couple.",

To be desired and sought after in that way even if maybe your feelings aren’t so strong is still hard to walk away from. Everyone likes some form of attention like that much we know.  Now of course, provided he doesn’t take it too far and understands what being respectful is.  Does that seem about right?\n\nI think it’s what women even if they say “I hate men” 1/10th of them still kinda likes being “seen” by men.\n\nI think when men pull back, like a lot of men, it freaks women out.  Like if someone always seemed to care about you all the time, even when it seemed unbearable at times and then BOOM.  Crickets.  Dead silence, hell not even an eye that wanders in your general direction.  No interest, no talking, dead silent.  That would be a shock to say the least.\n\nMen we are way better at remembering pain than people think.  We can absolutely lock down and give a hard no to anything that pushed us too far.\n\nThere is an unwritten “bro code” or “man law” that a man should strive to never make the same mistake twice.  Highly frowned on.  It’s cringe in the men’s world.  To be wrong about things you damn well knew better.  But men break that rule all the time for a woman.  All the time.",

Any woman who actually wanted to connect with a man as much as men wish to connect with women in general would have a much, much easier time going about it than vice versa, and yet it is still men who take the initiative and struggle the most to approach, and who also display the greatest extent of actual suffering due to the 'loneliness' that results from the degeneration of the relationship between the genders to the point that it is unofficially classified as the 'male loneliness epidemic'.\n\nI therefore disagree with your statement that men and women are going through the same thing, and maintain that women are not attracted to the average man. Women are alone because they cannot get the minority of men they actually like, and men are alone because most women don't like them. It's just not the same thing, and you can see how it manifests in very different ways in real life, as well as online. I do think that the dynamics between the genders will continue to deteriorate further, possibly to the point of becoming essentially defunct, as women get more independence and financial freedom so as to no longer need relationships of convenience with men like millennial and older women did (which is a good thing. Everyone should be free to live as they wish).",

Most women abroad realize that inviting strangers into their personal life by posting on social media is just a recipe for drama. They also learn early on that the best looking men are often pieces of shit who will treat them like shit. Women in America just seem to keep going repeatedly after the same type of guy (tall, fit, and toxic) and it takes many of them years to learn that this will likely lead to problems as these men have plenty of options in dating and can just cycle through however many women go after them. Instead of saying “hey maybe I’m the problem” and changing how they approach dating they just go online and complain about ALL men being shitty.\n\nA huge part of all of this is the TikTok creator program which only exists in a few countries. People in these countries are basically paid for their views so making toxic and often stupid content results in $$$ in the bank. This program doesn’t exist in most of the rest of world so people aren’t constantly exposed to the noise and convinced to join the hive mind to get paid.\n\nI live in Costa Rica and am married to a local woman. Her social media feed isn’t filled with ads, doesn’t contain political or gender war nonsense, and she keeps her private life private because there’s no financial incentive to invite strangers into it. It’s very peaceful.",
