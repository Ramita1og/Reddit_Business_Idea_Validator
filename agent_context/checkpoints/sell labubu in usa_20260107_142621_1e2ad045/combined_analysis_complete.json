            "title": "GameStop, PopMart, and Deep Value",
            "content": "Disclaimer: I used ChatGPT for some of these numbers, so if they are off a bit blame Sam Altman.\n\nTL;DR GameStop and PopMart have a very comparable business model (blind box vs. power packs) and similarly high collectibles growth rates. GameStop has far more potential based on social presence, partnerships, brand followers, retail presence, U.S. consumer base, and capital resources. But GameStop enterprise value is $0 and 0x revenue multiple, while PopMart’s EV is $52.7b on 13x revenue multiple.\n\nI am starting to think that GameStop is trying to mimic the PopMart business model. I am not sure this company has been discussed in these parts, but the strategies are quite similar.\n\nPopMart is a Chinese company that sells little toy collectibles. They are on fire right now. They did $2b in revenue in 2024 and are set to do $4b in 2025, with a $52.7b market cap (13x revenue).\n\nThey have about 2,500 robo locations (vending machines) across the globe, as well as around 600 staffed retail stores. GameStop has 2,500 staffed retail in USA - the best consumer market in the world by far (retail / consumer presence is far more valuable).\n\nTheir blind box model (mystery collectible unbox) is swallowing the revenue share. It’s growing like wild fire and accounts for over half of their revenue (from like 20% a couple of years ago). They also create all of their own IP (designer toys), the main one being Labubu. The blind box model is fairly similar to Power Packs - buy an item and receive an item back in a range of value, with the main difference being that they are using their own IP. I would argue mixing 3rd party IP is actually a bigger opportunity. I would also argue that power packs is a better model, because they don’t have to regenerate low demand inventory and just buy it back and recycle it. But I am smoothest of brains.\n\nWe have been wondering about the revival of Buck the Bunny for a while. But something is definitely coming with that IP. I would not be shocked if they launched a blind box model (using Pokémon, Minecraft, Fortnite, and GameStop IP), but I would imagine at the very least that they create trading cards for Power Packs using GameStop IP. I believe the stapler is a Wall Street taunt, and he threw the underwear in to prove a point that GameStop can turn anything they want into a collectible, including RC’s own panties. Fear is a tool. \n\nGameStop is setting the market and liquidity for the collectibles they share through Power Packs and the buy back offers. Although they should wield this power exceptionally carefully and avoid NFT / crypto style ponzi systems, this does give them an advantage to carve out sustainable high demand collectibles using their own IP and conservatively setting the market through buy backs, while also avoiding regulatory concerns.\n\nComparing only apples to apples, GameStop should easily hit $800m in collectibles revenue this year. I would bet they hit $1b in a massive growth year, etc. but we will see. Their growth rate is around 50% at the moment for collectibles. I bet we see multiple years in a row of over 100% growth in this area. However, using the current metrics, GameStop has a comparable market value of their collectibles segment at around $5b, right now, using a 5-6x multiple based on 50% growth vs. PopMart’s 100% and 12x multiple.\n\nWe haven’t even seen the tip of the iceberg yet and the company is valued 35% lower than their cash + collectibles segment. \n\nGameStop also has 5x the retail footprint (especially in USA) and at least 10x the total social presence (X, IG, Reddit, etc). \n\nThe PRO or brand club members - PopMart has like 50m (90% of their sales come from) and GameStop has around 60m. Almost all of GameStop customers are US based, PopMart’s are 60% from mainland China. GameStop also has 6m people paying $25 annually for their pro tier.\n\nGameStop has significantly more capital, as well as access to what appears to be infinite amounts. I would argue that the potential is exponentially higher than PopMart’s given the cultural goodwill, cult like US based following, access to capital, and one of the savviest and most relentless leaders of our time.\n\nHowever, GameStop’s entire enterprise value is worth $0, or even quite negative if you consider forward EV and time value of money, while PopMart’s is worth $50b+. Almost every metric of GameStop’s is significantly better, at the potential level. And now the company is surrounded by the top collectibles minds on the planet to execute.\n\nThere is a pretty decent argument that apples to apples, GameStop should be trading at significantly higher multiples than PopMart and theoretically should be able to sustain a $100b market cap based on comparable growth metrics, right now.\n\nWe are in deep fucking value territory. Stop fucking fighting. Let em cook. \n",
