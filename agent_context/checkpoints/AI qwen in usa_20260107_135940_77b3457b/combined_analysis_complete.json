            "content": "Article is probably paywalled so here’s a summary: \n\nCurrently, GPUs are considered essential to run large AI models because of their capability for parallel processing. Meanwhile, CPUs - found in regular devices - are considered inefficient for such purposes since they are suited for more sequential tasks. \n\nZiroh Labs have developed a system in partnership with IIT Madras which runs these large AI models using CPUs. The system has been tested by Intel and AMD and has successfully run models including DeepSeek, Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen. A while back Google’s own tests demonstrated that CPUs can achieve competent latencies for large language models, though typically requiring larger batch sizes to match GPU efficiency. \n\nThis is significant since specialised hardware / GPU infrastructure is quite expensive and mostly accessible to large corporations. The restrictions on export / sale of GPUs by the USA has exacerbated this problem. Ziroh’s stuff could make AI compute power far more accessible by eliminating the need for such hardware. ",
