And I say that with love - I remember ordering the Blue Neighbourhood CD and listening to it on my long drives to college classes. I commiserated with his sad, gay life while staring out at the gloomy winter weather. He’s always been a boy next door, a wallflower, allowing himself space to make pensive tracks about longing, breakups, or the moments in between, but seemingly apprehensive about taking up space outside of that, leaving the flashy, colorful moments for artists like Charli XCX or Kim Petras.\n\nIt might have to do with where he started. Troye’s career began very early in acting (most notably in the 2009 Wolverine) and spent a lot of time in the public eye with a successful youtube channel and a run singing on various Austrailian telethons and reality shows, and even independently released an [EP of covers](https://troye.fandom.com/wiki/Dare_to_Dream) in 2007. This led to him signing to EMI Australia in 2013, and he released his first major label EP, “[TRXYE](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Trxye)” the following year. It performed significantly well, even sending the single “[Happy Little Pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEWHF3E9YJQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” to the Australian Top 10. He followed it up with another EP, [Wild](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Wild), in 2015.\n\n[Blue Neighbourhood](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Blue-neighbourhood) was his first album, and was preceded with the [Blue Neighborhood Trilogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xCMF7jsDJI&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO), a series of music videos detailing a story of Troye and his love interest growing up together and struggling with their relationship and the world around them. The album was released in December of 2015, and had a dark, synthpop and r&b sound that drew comparisons to Lorde, Halsey, and Sam Smith. It featured Troye’s first Billboard Hot 100 hit “[Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAghEq5Lfw&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” as well as “[Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3awzvNrKDsg&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, which received a [remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8G4oaOxyxk&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO) featuring Alessia Cara. It’s a solid debut, very modern and slick for its time. It didn’t reinvent any wheels, but it also didn’t chase after loud, trendy sounds that many younger artists would have. The songwriting felt strong, even if a bit nonspecific at times. At its worst, Troye leans on aesthetics and gloomy lyrics too heavily, and at its best, you have a song like “[Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VNV__mV38s&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, an intimate look into Troye’s internal struggles with coming out.\n\nTroye then featured on Martin Garrix’s “[There For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNNMr5glICM&ab_channel=MartinGarrix)” in 2017 which was an international hit and scored his second appearance on the Billboard Hot 100. It seemed like the perfect drop to help introduce him to a larger audience as he prepared for his next album, [Bloom](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Bloom). Led off by the first single, “[My My My!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5TqNsr6YuQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, it marked a shift from the soft boy Troye and into something more mature. The album, released in 2018, featured 80’s leaning production, and lyrics that gave more insight into his experience as a young, gay man. Songs like “[Seventeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pxdGNVqwnA&ab_channel=TroyeSivan-Topic)” and “[The Good Side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ay4S61byZo&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” marked an improvement in his lyricism, exploring adult themes and break ups, and even the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PTANtZFW0&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO) was a euphemism for [bottoming](https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/39346/1/troye-sivan-boy-erased-new-album-interview). It was a striking return for Troye, but it still felt restrained: take “[Dance to This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrMAfMbZOmg&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, an Ariana Grande featuring track that bounces along a mellow, mid tempo groove and never allows more than a simple headnod, despite the title suggesting otherwise. Troye always keeps his cool, and the production predictably follows suit.\n\nBy the time we get to his next release, Troye had been featured on soundtracks, done features for alt pop girlies like [Charli XCX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-v1b9waHWY&ab_channel=CharliXCX) and [Allie X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqiNs6tui-o&ab_channel=AllieX), and even had a bonafide worldwide hit in “[I’m So Tired…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvjpE_wFL5A&ab_channel=Lauv)” with up and coming artist Lauv. In 2020, Troye releases [In a Dream](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/In-a-dream-ep), a concept EP that features songs that he wrote during the ending of his Bloom tour, as well as during the ending of his relationship with model [Jacob Bixenman](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/troye-sivan-jacob-bixenman-768x479.png), likening the 7 songs as a time capsule. The EP saw Troye combining experimental dance sounds with indie pop; songs like \"[STUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5clCt1bsE&ab_channel=TroyeSivan-Topic)\" and the back half of “[Take Yourself Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUz2llONqNE&ab_channel=DesertRecords)” featuring heavy bass and techno sounds, while the laid back “[Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCHqIhiFmEY&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” and euphoric “[IN A DREAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cHHnj3xWnw&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” kept some of Troye’s signature earmarks. “Easy” even saw a [re-release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn4XQ9WweRY&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO) as a single featuring a new instrumental from Mark Ronson and a vocal feature from Kacey Musgraves.\n\nThe last few years leading up to Something To Give Each Other saw the release of “[Angel Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyYwOEKKcZc&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, his first song to go viral on TikTok, the lead role in the film “Three Months”, and collaborations with DJs (Regard’s “You” with Tate McRae and PNAU’s “You Know What I Need”). Most notably, in 2023, Troye starred (HBO) Max’s ambitious drama, *The Idol*, alongside The Weeknd and Lily Rose Depp. This show was an edgy, dark take on the everyday life of a popstar, and was written by both The Weeknd and *Euphoria’s* Sam Levinson. It seemed like a promising choice for Troye, as it caught a lot of media buzz when announced, a great stepping stone for Troye before his comeback the same year.\n\n[Something To Give Each Other](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Something-to-give-each-other) released on October 13th, a few months out from the summer vibes it seemed to promise. “Rush” and “Got Me Started” were released as singles before, both songs generating a lot of hype for this album. These songs seemed to herald a *different* Troye, someone embracing gay culture head on, someone with a newfound wisdom for his experiences. What we got is honestly Troye at his best (so far). It’s a well curated, well produced, strikingly cohesive, and an expensive sounding project. Most importantly, though, it sounds distinct to Troye, elevating his voice with tasteful dance tracks. His lyricism gets more conversational and personal, showcasing a previously unseen nuance. The album theme centers around heartbreak, connection, and community, exemplified by the title, *Something to Give Each Other,* as in every connection we make, *we give each other something*. During the pandemic, Troye fantasized about being around people and experienced it with new eyes after lockdown ended. It reinvigorated his love for partying, for physicality, and for love (in all its forms). He describes it as writing from a fantasy, as if the party is a religious experience. It’s an especially refreshing take from Troye, a warm and corporeal album, inviting you with every beat, every feeling, every tear, and every drop of sweat.\n\n# TRACK by TRACK\n\n**Rush**\n\n*“I feel the rush*”\n\nA group (of what I imagine would be hunky) men chanting captures your attention immediately as the song kicks off. “*Addicted to your touch*” they add, over a bumping four on the floor beat. Four claps pan across your headphones and we’re off - It’s “[Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53QJYP-lqY&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, Troye’s comeback single. After weeks and weeks of heavy teasing on TikTok, the song had reached levels of hype more than any previous Troye song had received before. Partially due to the [ifykyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppers) song title, and a sound that was incredibly different from anything Troye had released, it managed to capture the ears of casual listeners and popheads alike. And it lived up to its hype.\n\nComing in at a short 2 minutes 30 seconds, “Rush” is a commanding house track that’s perfect for summer. Breezy, warm production? Check. Hedonistic lyrics? Absolutely. A chorus that recalls the chanting of [YMCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS9OO0S5w2k&ab_channel=VillagePeople)? *Why the hell not*? It’s Troye embracing a new side of himself - both personally and musically, something that’s refreshing to see from an artist that felt so reserved. Troye knows he’s *thee* go-to twink artist, and he’s ready to make himself at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What’s The Time Where You Are?**\n\nTroye welcomes you with a murmur: “[God, I wish it were you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivdf_W02ucg&ab_channel=TroyeSivan-Topic)”. The hot summer day of “Rush” turns into a hazy night out, and you’re suddenly in Troye’s inebriated headspace. Conversations directed at him are dizzily going in one ear and out the other, his friend exclaims, “Troye, baby, last night was fucking crazy… *what the fuuuuck!*”. It’s a whole vibe, driven by a fat bass, warm pads, and twinkling keys, all while Troye pines for his international love interest. The song was inspired by a text exchange, something that Troye felt was cute; an opening and offering to a conversation. The song reverberates with that feeling of longing, the hazy washes of chatter and synths representing Troye going in and out of the present. “I’m right on top of this groove, *but God I wish it was you*,” he affirms, intoxicated in his fervor. Piano keys accompany Troye on the outro hits like a rush of cool air and his voice feels intensely sober, as if he’s coming out of the club and into the cool, lonely, night air.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One of Your Girls**\n\nThere’s nothing like the music of a gay pining over a straight person. It’s probably one of my favorite genres, something so painfully relatable and hilariously tragic. Troye’s a bit of an expert on this experience, but there’s something that makes “[One of Your Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ0MhGhribE&ab_channel=TroyeSivan)” just *special.* At first listen, it might not seem particularly striking, with a mid tempo beat that chugs alongside some throwback synths. But it’s Troye that completely sells the song, his voice sounding vulnerable and affectionate. “Face card, no cash, no credit” he coos over some delicate guitar strumming, completely enamored by his crush. “*L-Look at you!*” he stutters, taken aback by the man’s beauty. It’s an ode to the straight and curious men he’s had experiences with, recalling texting them to hit him up if they \"feel gay for the weekend\". He tries to make them understand the infatuation they could have, but ultimately he has to meet them at their level: “I’ll be like one of your girls or your homies”. It’s these moments of weakness and relatability that Troye expertly details within the world of gay relationships. These conflicting feelings are mirrored in the song's outro, with the synth lead ([apparently played by Max Martin?](https://www.listnr.com/podcasts/behind-the-hits/episodes/troye-sivan-sex-censorship-self-acceptance)) distorting as Troye’s filtered vocals fill out the space. It’s almost as if he’s conceded to just be his straight friend’s plaything, a hollow robot whenever he gets lonely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In My Room**\n\nWritten about the first boy that broke Troye’s heart, “[In My Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX92lStRfMo&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” is a playful, little, funky tune, detailing his headspace after the breakup as a bedroom. He’s not quite ready to clean up the turmoil and sadness yet, he’d rather keep it “messy”. In line with the subject matter, the production captures the sounds of [bedroom pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGUom_AV4o&ab_channel=ClaireCottrill) (lofi beats and soft, funky basslines) and pairs them with lush, glamorous, strings. The album’s only feature, [Guitarricadelafuente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri02p05A25c&ab_channel=Guitarricadelafuente), details his imagination; flashes of images of his lover and confusing reality with lust and regret. It’s a wonderful pairing, with Troye’s breathier vocals contrasting with Guitarricadelafuerte’s more intimate tone. The song is the gift that keeps on giving, when the outro hits a new high with a key change and Troye singing the title of the album as if it’s a radio tag.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Still Got It**\n\nIf there’s one gripe I have of Troye’s music, it’d be that his ballads have a hard time balancing between genuine regret and mopey sadness. “[Still Got It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OUkc1b-HQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” reeks of the self indulgent ballads of his previous eras, drowning his sorrows in a faux-gospel moment. Organs accompany his woeful lyrics about being coerced into cutting his hair into a bowl cut, with the production reaching a sort of post-blond [Frank Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlz_XHeUUis&list=PLzoqV_VvWIwGzYTcm3r1JwqgQOBXTvKyd&index=15&ab_channel=Blonded) climax. It’s not that he isn’t convincing, but it ultimately feels like an unfortunate slow down after the first four tracks. Maybe that’s its purpose, a sudden realization of what could have been, but when the following track nails the feeling more poignantly, “Still Got It” loses the momentum without giving more emotional voice to make up for it. But for all of the “Got It” fans out there, just know it’s one of Troye’s personal favorites from the album - with him giving it a spotlight in [Live from Spotify’s Green Screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrc68U-DxWc&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can’t Go Back, Baby**\n\n“[Can’t Go Back, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS0e7nRzrUQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” is the funeral song for Troye’s past relationship, one that ended due to  his ex cheating on him (or, did he cheat on his ex? i couldn't find a definite answer). Built over a sample of Jessica Pratt’s beautiful “[Back, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3YxJ1OYrVo&ab_channel=JessicaPratt-Topic)”, Troye mourns the relationship as if in real time. It’s a gorgeously melancholic tune, with piano echoing as if pulled from a memory, the warm crackling of a vinyl record, and a soft four by four beat keeping time as the production swells. Troye says that he wrote this song from a place of anger, and while the song details his hurt, it progresses to a place of clarity and regret: “I lay with so much love to take your place”. The song builds beautifully on the tension of a failed relationship, the feeling of tenderness and betrayal of the feelings you still have for someone. All while looking to the morning sun with a newfound love for oneself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Got Me Started**\n\nYou’re greeted by the hook from Bag Raider’s “[Shooting Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MQC_G9jTU&ab_channel=BagRaiders-Topic)”, accompanied by indistinct chatter in the background - like the setting went from mournful morning after to a rooftop party. And what better way to shake off those haunting feelings than with a good time? Troye described this song as “remembering who you are and that people are hot” after “feeling emotionally dead after a traumatic relational experience”. The song commemorates his first crush post break up, detailing unspoken feelings and contains one of the best lyrics on the album: “we should experiment even to the detriment of whoever’s on the couch”. Troye is back.\n\nOn the production side, a song like “[Got Me Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjLcVqjIkLo&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” seems like it would trip over its own design: retooling a meme-y sample seems hardly revolutionary in the world of “[I’m Good (Blue)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90RLzVUuXe4&ab_channel=DavidGuetta)” and [Ava Max](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/olivia-rodrigo-doja-cat-interpolation-music-1220580/)’s discography, while a [2 step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5mEszYqjms&ab_channel=CraigDavidVEVO) beat placement should feel like playing catch up to [PinkPantheress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xVUg9GmDfg&ab_channel=Pinkpantheress) and [NewJeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OMfjwK3X44&ab_channel=Kpillus_MUSIC) more innovative (and influential) uses. But the track takes a more understated approach to allow space for Troye’s relaxed vocals to take center stage - all before cutting out for the “Shooting Star” hook to blister its way into your mind, with Troye’s heavily processed, pitch-shifted vocals harmonizing on the sample to build momentum. One could say it makes you feel like running through the streets of Bangkok in a shiny chrome outfit, like a speedy, twink(ly) disco ball.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Silly**\n\n“[Silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO5SXI-b_dg&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” finds Troye looking for love in the club. It’s an Ian Kirkpatrick-produced track with a muggy, hazy atmosphere and some of the most upfront vocal processing on the album - a choice by Troye to experiment and have fun, a theme that also runs in the lyrics. As he wanders around a party, trying to get out of his head, he downplays his true feelings as “silly” and seeks connections as a way to get further from the rut that he was in post break up. However, he ultimately is a self confessed “love junkie” and can’t push the feelings away. As the track expands into a dizzying, chill, almost [european club tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Z3YrHJ1sU&ab_channel=Spinnin%27Records), his own words echo and fade in and out, never quite letting go of what he really wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Honey**\n\nInspired by the Jewish Serenity Prayer that was taught to him as a child by his father, this is probably the closest Troye gets to taking you to church - or synagogue, rather. “[Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmiBaxJEzuw&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” summons the spacious, uplifting sound of Lorde’s “[Ribs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7pE8AG1jjE&ab_channel=Lorde-Topic)” and dials it up to stadium levels. That was his goal, too - he calls it a “confetti moment” for his live shows. It’s a euphoric house track, with a guitar riff that recalls Janet Jackson’s “[Someone to Call My Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfP5HOIn8vk&ab_channel=JanetJackson-Topic)” and a drop that glistens and distorts, barely containing the overwhelming emotions underneath. “I see love in every space,” declares Troye, drunk on the honey of the music, lust, and connection between the two. “Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to,” he sings. The chorus swoops in, with Troye praying to a higher power for strength to communicate his feelings, but it’s not pleading, it’s joyous. This loss for words is a privilege, maybe it’s a fleeting feeling, but maybe it doesn’t need to be said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How To Stay With You**\n\n“[How To Stay With You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGXll5TIOEk&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” is the much deserved victory lap that closes the album. The song is warm like an embrace, thanks to its relaxed tempo, funky bass and keys (courtesy of A. G. Cook). Troye ruminates over his crush, and the excitement of a blossoming relationship. “I feel like my mother might like you, just not in the same way I do” he teases in a sing-songy melody. There’s a genuine feeling of affection throughout this song, even when he sings “turn my bussy out”. Even if there’s an underlying uncertainty in the lyrics, we finally see Troye excited at the prospect of a new relationship, a new optimism springing up. It’s nostalgic and chill, the sort of song that will have you slow dancing while the sax solo plays you into the morning light.\n\n# The Twinkprint\n\n“*Something to Give Each Other*” was quite the success for Troye - although if you’re comparing success according to some chart or sales metrics, you might not find too many impressive stats. But I’m not talking about numbers, what Troye did was far more important than that. Similar to [Carly Rae Jepsen](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/)’s or [Charli XCX’](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charli-xcx-pop-2/)s careers, he focused on artistic integrity by curating a cohesive album, all the while using visuals to create conversations leading up to the release. This is an impressive feat for Troye, an artist who seemed destined to never stray from his comfort zone. Whether it was [viral choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk0XlOmc8lQ&ab_channel=asdfghelimar), overt gay themes ([glory hole](https://us.troyesivanstore.com/products/rush-exclusive-limited-glory-edition-7) cam?!), or crossdressing and giving [Ross Lynch a lap dance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WYt2C_40iDg), Troye expertly navigated the pop space through generating buzz, hyping older fans and piquing the curiosity of casual listeners. And more importantly, he pulled it off almost effortlessly, never blinking twice at experimenting with sounds or image. This is never clearer than in the album art, his head nestled between a nude man’s legs, his face in open laughter. Troye shared that he was self conscious and he didn’t smile for all of the photoshoot until his friend tickled him. It's a great look into Troye’s experiences and new worldview, a growth that I hope to see him build upon in future releases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4 Questions that We Can Give Each Other\n\n* Were you familiar with Troye’s music before this album, and if so, did this change your opinion of him as an artist?\n* If *Something to Give Each Other* got a remix album, which artists would you like to see on what tracks?\n* Where would you like to see Troye take his music in the future? Any particular genres or sounds you wish he’d explore?\n* This album experiences (particularly queer) community through music and partying, are there any other albums you feel do the same?",

            "content": "I have two jobs. Or, had. I'm pretty sure I'll quit both of them after what happened last night.\n\nDuring the  day, I’m a plumber. Whenever I enter a home, I scan it for valuable  stuff. Jewelry, electronics... whatever I can sell.\n\nYesterday morning, I entered the Collins’ house. I greeted Mrs. Collins, a chipper housewife with an “I want to speak to the manager” haircut, and let her lead me through the house right to the master bedroom. The en suite bathroom, she explained to me on our way up the stairs, had smelled horrible for the last couple of days. They suspected the smell  came out of the pipes.\n\nI  nodded patiently, letting out the occasional grunt to assure her I was listening. Nice paintings on the walls, bedroom with two kids’ beds, and  I think I caught sight of a DJI Phantom drone, carelessly left on the  brightly colored rug. Those babies cost over a thousand bucks. Yep, I was coming back.\n\nThe  master bedroom was a little bit messier than I had expected. Some  pieces of bright red lingerie were flung over a chair (Note: used  panties sell like sliced bread) and the bed was all rumpled, with  pillows almost tumbling down to the floor. I chuckled a little. Looks  like Mr and Mrs Collins had had quite the night.\n\nAfter inspecting the bathroom (which indeed had a foul smell to it), I quickly figured out what the problem was. The odor was emitting from the sink, which probably hadn’t been cleaned properly in years. So I gave the pipes a good, thorough cleaning, and trotted back downstairs.\n\nMrs  Collins was busying herself in the kitchen and barely glanced up when I  came to stand in the doorway. I shortly explained to her what had been  done and told her she would receive the bill in the mail.\n\n“Great, thank you so much” she said, barely looking up from her crock pot and smiling like she’d just stepped into duck shit.\n\nI lingered for a second, letting my gaze drift across the room. My eyes fell on four tickets, pinned to the refridgerator.\n\n“So you’re going to the circus tonight?” After she shot me a confused look, I pointed at the tickets. “Brumbleberry Family Circus. I’ve been there a couple of times with my kid. It’s a great show!” I didn’t have a kid, of course.\n\n“Oh. Yeah, we’re very excited about it. Family trip”, Mrs Collins replied with that same forced smile.\n\nEight hours later I returned to their house. As expected, everything was dark and silent. Perfect.\n\nI went through my usual routine and soon found myself standing in their hallway. This gig was a breeze. I made my way through the house, up the stairs and debated on which room to take first. I finally settled on the master bedroom, to get the jewelry and the lingerie.\n\nMore  out of habit, I opened the door slowly, listening intently to my surroundings. You never know, right? Nothing was to be heard, so I pushed it open all the way. And proceeded to let out the biggest fucking  yelp that has ever left my mouth.\n\nMrs  Collins and what I assume was her husband weren’t at the circus. They were in their beds. Her in the lingerie I had seen earlier, and him in some plaid pajamas. But the pajamas weren’t the most terryfing thing.\n\nThey  were both sitting upright in bed, their heads turned towards me, and smiling. Not that horror movie, unnaturally wide grin. No, just a regular smile. It seemed sincere.\n\nWith a pounding heart and barely being able to pull myself out of my stupor, I held up my hands.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry, I thought you were... Tell you what, I’ll just...” I stopped abruptly as I noticed that there  was no reaction whatsoever. Just this... very upright position, and  that *smile*. God, I can’t get it out of my head. It was as if they knew  exactly who I was. As if they’d been waiting for me. Happy that I  finally came. I don’t know how else to describe it.\n\nSuddenly  I felt very cold. Whatever was going on  here wasn’t normal, and it sure as hell wasn’t right. You know that  feeling of impending doom you sometimes get? Especially in the middle of  the night, after you’ve watched a horror movie and need to go to the  bathroom? That feeling that if you get up and leave your bed now, you’re  gonna regret it badly?\n\nIt took me only seconds to make the decision. I had to get the fuck out of here.\n\nI  snapped out of my trance and spun around to race back through the  hallway – only to be faced with the two Collins kids, standing inches  away from me. A boy and a girl, maybe between four and eight years old, I  don’t know. Holdings hands and just standing there, smiling at me. As if I was their favorite uncle who’d come to visit, or Santa Claus, or  Barney. The girl was wearing some kind of Disney princess nightgown, and the boy’s pajamas were a miniature version of his dad’s.\n\nJust for a moment, I held my breath. I don’t know, I think was waiting for them to say something. *Anything*.\n\nBut they didn’t. They just stood there, smiling happily.\n\nAgain,  I told myself that if I had to be the poor chap in the first five minutes of Supernatural, I at least wouldn’t be as stupid and try to find out what’s going on. So finally, finally I snapped out of it and ran like a mad man. Anything to get out of this place.\n\nI  almost couldn’t believe it when I jumped into my car and sped away. I was sure they’d come after me, that they wouldn’t just let me get away. But no, I got home safely. No police, no crazy family waiting for me.\n\nBy the time morning came around and I dared to leave the safety of my bed, I had a message from my boss on my phone.\n\n*Chad, you been to Colorado Drive yesterday, right? Mrs Collins called and said they want you to come back, they still got the smell problem and want you to clean all pipes in teh house. Let me know when your done. Thx.*\n\nWell, fuck.",

            "content": "Dear all,\n\nI have seen over the last week that people speculate the lack of stock of the OP3 to be a reason for an upcoming OP4. As in, DJI needs to clear stock. I fear it is not that simple and is simply wishful thinking.\n\nBased on DJI's previous update cycle, the Osmo Pocket 4 is estimated to *potentially* launch in **late 2026 or early 2027**.\n\nWhile reports from late 2024 and early 2025 indicated that the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 was frequently out of stock, current listings on the DJI Store, Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.es and Amazon.de show the product as being in stock (mainly creator combo). This suggests that while **initial demand outstripped supply**, production has likely slowly caught up now. However, some retailers may still experience occasional backorders. Best Buy also lists the Creator Combo as available for pickup or shipping.\n\nSource for the increased demand:\n\nDJI cameras sold 80 million yuan worth in a month and were snapped up by Xiaohongshu girls until out of stock | Focus analysis-36氪 ([https://eu-36kr-com.translate.goog/en/p/3191660720398726?\\_x\\_tr\\_sl=en&\\_x\\_tr\\_tl=bg&\\_x\\_tr\\_hl=bg&\\_x\\_tr\\_pto=sc](https://eu-36kr-com.translate.goog/en/p/3191660720398726?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=bg&_x_tr_hl=bg&_x_tr_pto=sc))  \n  \nDJI's Pocket 3 is selling out faster than it can restock— ...
