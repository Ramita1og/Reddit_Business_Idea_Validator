      "title": "DJI Osmo Pocket 4: Rumors and Speculations - DJI Osmo Pocket 3 low in stock or not?",
      "desc": "Dear all,\n\nI have seen over the last week that people speculate the lack of stock of the OP3 to be a reason for an upcoming OP4. As in, DJI needs to clear stock. I fear it is not that simple and is simply wishful thinking.\n\nBased on DJI's previous update cycle, the Osmo Pocket 4 is estimated to *potentially* launch in **late 2026 or early 2027**.\n\nWhile reports from late 2024 and early 2025 indicated that the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 was frequently out of stock, current listings on the DJI Store, Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.es and Amazon.de show the product as being in stock (mainly creator combo). This suggests that while **initial demand outstripped supply**, production has likely slowly caught up now. However, some retailers may still experience occasional backorders. Best Buy also lists the Creator Combo as available for pickup or shipping.\n\nSource for the increased demand:\n\nDJI cameras sold 80 million yuan worth in a month and were snapped up by Xiaohongshu girls until out of stock | Focus analysis-36氪 ([https://eu-36kr-com.translate.goog/en/p/3191660720398726?\\_x\\_tr\\_sl=en&\\_x\\_tr\\_tl=bg&\\_x\\_tr\\_hl=bg&\\_x\\_tr\\_pto=sc](https://eu-36kr-com.translate.goog/en/p/3191660720398726?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=bg&_x_tr_hl=bg&_x_tr_pto=sc))  \n  \nDJI's Pocket 3 is selling out faster than it can restock— ... ([https://kr-asia.com/djis-pocket-3-is-selling-out-faster-than-it-can-restock-heres-why](https://kr-asia.com/djis-pocket-3-is-selling-out-faster-than-it-can-restock-heres-why))\n\nSo the conclusion is pretty simple: **DJI fell behind in production when demand skyrocketed.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNow to the \"rumours\":  <-- **DISCLAIMER: None of this is factual**\n\nThe DJI Osmo Pocket 4 is generating excitement in the creative community, or so they want us to believe. While **concrete details remain scarce (*****as in non-existent*****)**. Most of the so-called \"rumours\" are **pure fiction**. So bear that in mind when you read on.\n\nI have collected most of the \"**gossip**\" rumours available to the public, just bear in mind, many (most) of them are **pure spin**, **speculation** and **clickbait**. *You have been warned.* \n\nSo here we go for those who have the time and wish to dream a bit, and maybe get a good laugh:\n\n  \n\\[1\\] DJI OSMO POCKET 4 - Biggest Upgrade Over DJI Pocket 3! - YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDo8BmDCjH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDo8BmDCjH0))\n\n\\[2\\] DJI Pocket 4 Creator Combo or DJI Mirrorless ([https://thenewcamera.com/dji-pocket-4-creator-combo-or-dji-mirrorless-whats-next-from-dji/](https://thenewcamera.com/dji-pocket-4-creator-combo-or-dji-mirrorless-whats-next-from-dji/))\n\n\\[3\\] DJI OSMO POCKET 4 - Leaks, Specs, Release Date ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hETkneTk5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hETkneTk5s))\n\n\\[4\\] DJI Osmo Pocket 4 – Should You Wait for This?

          "content": "FYI, the tariff situation only affects the US for now. I think DJI does not even care anymore. Their market is not based on the US.  If you read the first link in my post, you would understand that is was China who dried up their stock and is responsible for the shortage, not the rest of the world. US [blacklilsting](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/worlds-largest-drone-maker-dji-is-unfazed-by-challenges-like-us-blacklist.html) DJI also didn't have any i[mpact](https://droneii.com/drone-market-shares-usa-after-china-usa-disputes) on them. You can read further on the subject here: [Has the U.S. Trade War Changed DJI’s Drone Market Share?](https://dronelife.com/2021/03/05/has-the-u-s-china-trade-war-changed-djis-drone-market-share-the-latest-from-drone-industry-insights/)\n\nSo, no, the tariff is not a reason for DJI not launching a product. You should search for what they have already launched this year and what they will launch. The list is quite impressive.\n\nAnyway, just my 2 cents. \n\nHappy postings and shooting. 🎥✨",

      "title": "Pussy Cats",
      "desc": "This album is Pussy Cats, produced by John Lennon. The title is a nod to the bad press Lennon and Nilsson received during Lennon’s ‘lost weekend.’ There is also an inside joke hidden on the cover — if you can spot it, comment below.\n\nThe album is infamous for the screaming sessions between Lennon and Nilsson, which ultimately ruptured Harry’s vocal cords. He hid the injury from Lennon, fearing the project would be abandoned. His voice never fully recovered, and this marked a turning point in his career.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Paul McCartney dropped by and played with Lennon. This remains the only known recording of the two of them performing together after the Beatles split. The sessions themselves were often described as little more than a chaotic party, with Lennon eventually having to pull everyone back on track.\n\nMy favorite tracks, in no particular order, are Don’t Forget Me, All My Life, Old Forgotten Soldier, Save the Last Dance for Me, and Mucho Mungo / Mt. Elga.",

      "desc": "Been very busy recently and haven't had time to put out any reviews, so here is everything I've copped since CNY. I have about 15KG more still coming, but shipped that via EMS and it's mad slow.  \n  \n**This review is formatted to be viewed on a desktop, for maximum viewing experience please use a PC.**   \n  \n  \n*In the interest of full disclosure, some of this haul was received with a 10% discount due to my past reviews for these sellers. This does not change my opinion on any of these pieces, and everything I say is my honest beliefs of these pieces. I do not gain any commission or anything from your purchases from these stores. If you choose not to purchase any of these goods from the store I purchased from, I've provided links to other options at the bottom of my post with the same/similar batches for the similar prices if you would still like to get the same quality I did.*  \n  \n  \n---  \n    \n#Jackets/Hoodies  \n\nItem/Link | Pictures | Review\n---|---|----\n[**Gucci Technical Jacket**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.38.749f48b6IFG8Zs&id=566575140758) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/UcCDE) | Extremely high quality jacket, weighs around 1.2KG. Metal aglets, snaps, and all hardware.\n[**Off-White Mona Lisa Hoodie**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.99.7fe548b6ZAxe3W&id=565743968668) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/1VZOO) | Without a doubt, best cop this haul. The color is perfect, the blank is extremely comfortable, the print is on-point, and it's by far the nicest hoodie I own now. Matches the Off-White summer-styled blanks perfectly. For some reason the photos came out saturated/weird contrast, but this piece is amazing.\n[**Vetements Rainbows and Unicorn Hoodie**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.72.7f3448b667W20p&id=565569336729) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/hUfUB) | Grabbed this for bae, not as heavy as retail, but still around a KG. Print is good, embroidery is decent. Still a sick hoodie, I'll be copping myself it in Navy once it drops. \n   \n#Shirts  \n   \nItem/Link | Pictures | Review\n---|---|----\n[**Ben Tavernetti Unravel Projects Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.60.7f3448b667W20p&id=565570576625) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/Cl44F) | Very happy to see smaller brands being repped, this shirt is awesome. Soft blank, print is good. I don't think most people know the brand, but I really like the stuff they put out.\n[**Fear of God 1997 AllStar Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=557952125096) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/wD21j) | Simply put, a must cop from GMan. Everything on this is perfect from the blank to the tags. My favorite tee.\n[**Fear of God 1997 AllStar Longsleeve**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=556959827577) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/9uCDK) | Another must cop, GMan mastered the 1997 collaboration. Blanks on these are amazing.\n[**Fear of God 4th Collection Striped Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=541117804867) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/USKbW) | I've had this one in retail, and this rep is 1:1. Stitching, tags, materials are all on point.\n[**Fear of God 5th Collection Jersey**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=555099450168) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/POLaq) | Very comfortable piece, but not 1:1. Has very minor connected stitching on the patch. Tags and blank are on point.\n[**Fear of God Jay-Z Tour Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564461387770) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/luf5G) | Kind of a let down, but not unexpected. As with 99% of reps that have many non-Chinese city names on them, there are a fair amount of typos. Streetporter refunded me 20yuan after complaining, so not all is lost.\n[**Fear of God Maxfield 2016 Staff Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.34.22422c74Lkf6Nz&id=562697953615&ns=1&abbucket=11#detail) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/ZYzRK) | Copped this one from a random store, and copped the black one below from GMan thinking they would be the same batch. Wrong. GMan has a way better blank, and more accurate print/tags. YMMV, the better blank is worth the extra money.\n[**Fear of God Maxfield 2016 Staff Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=547463301524) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/pHPb2) | I think GMan might just be Jerry Lorenzo selling old stock, because almost all of his blanks are identical to retail. I recommend him like crazy, and he is well worth it.\n[**Fear of God Maxfield 2017 Staff Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564461387770) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/LKe2P) | Very dope tee, just thin blank. Wish GMan made it, but this is still a must cop none the less.\n[**Gucci AC/DC Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.63.7f3448b667W20p&id=565569640950) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/Zn12U) | Super sick tee, print is amazing on it. The blank dye process is a lot more accurate than prior batches, I recommend copping it now. Looks so sick in person.\n[**Gucci Backprint Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.39.34c048b6xDNyQE&id=565839327301) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/2ideP) | Super simple but comfortable tee. Kinda weird Gucci made the print on the back, I would have preferred the front. Nonetheless, print is very good and so is the blank/tags.\n[**Gucci Coco Capitan Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.83.749f48b6i6M24I&id=565941342509) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/tH0RR) | This tee is silky smooth, and fits amazing. Finally a Gucci tee rep that is long enough for my tall self. XL clocks in at 81cm length.\n[**Gucci Guccification Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.78.34c048b6xDNyQE&id=564801239183) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/VoFIX) | Picked the next few tees up for my girl, print is very clean and blanks are very nice.\n[**Gucci Guccify Yourself Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.105.7f3448b667W20p&id=565681013155) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/bmote) | Again, great print and blank. These are very high quality tees.\n[**Gucci Red Mesh Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.84.7fe548b6ZAxe3W&id=565746144144) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/JIoGW) | Picked this up for my girl to wear to Coachella, so if you see a couple with the girl wearing this, come say hi. Stretchy jersey-like blank, print is good.\n[**Louis Vuitton Color Block Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.108.7fe548b6ZAxe3W&id=565734156561) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/JV2za) | Beautiful tee, hang tags look really fake though. Don't flex those, just flex the tee. Print is good, blank is good.\n[**Louis Vuitton Turtleneck Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.57.7f3448b667W20p&id=565761734064) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/VKIzH) | After seeing the fits that people have been pulling off with this, it was a must cop. Super soft and classy tee.\n[**Off-White Accident Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=0.7095261.0.0.3c121debhrZhAv&id=566575000459) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/DJyQ5) | Was super sad after selling my hoodie version of this, so copped the tee for summer. The colors pop like crazy on this, and it is stunning in person.\n[**Off-White Caravaggio Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.81.7f3448b667W20p&id=565683533244) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/2hAfu) | After 2 years of trying, repmakers have finally gotten decent rep Off-White tee blanks. This shirt is scary accurate to retail, and one of my top tee cops this haul. Must cop.\n[**Off-White For All 01 Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.51.34c048b6xDNyQE&id=565564752507) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/VxeSe) | Curious to see what Off-White will do with this \"For All\" line they've started. I think this tee was a good start, and the print and blank are already perfect on the reps. Cop.\n[**Off-White Galaxy Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.45.34c048b6xDNyQE&id=565755258304) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/E3398) | Good rep of this tee, if this is your style, this is a cop. I prefer the \"Accident\" tee over this, but both are very good reps.\n[**Stone Island Compass Tee**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.68.749f48b6i6M24I&id=566120148842) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/BPssO) | Picked this up for my friend's birthday, looks pretty good. IIRC something about the front print is off on the colored versions, not sure if that is true for the white? If anyone can chime in that would be great.\n    \n#Pants  \n  \nItem/Link | Pictures | Review\n---|---|----\n[**Prada 018 Track Pants**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.86.749f48b6i6M24I&id=565864837382) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/Wlok8) | These things are sooooooooo sick, but also aren't meant for us muscular boys. Waist can fit a 34, but if you have any sort of muscle/mass on your thighs you will have a hard time. Hoping another larger size comes out, because these are amazing quality and look so good in person.\n[**Burberry Archive Rainbow Sweats**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-17804935919.80.749f48b6i6M24I&id=565750684406) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/2MQua) | When these were announced, every rep sub shut down for a solid week with people consistentally posting about these. Repmakers came through, and these are amazing. By far the comfiest sweats I have ever owned, and I've already worn these 6 different times this week.\n  \n      \n#Accessories  \n  \nItem/Link | Pictures | Review\n---|---|----\n[**Louis Vuitton Pocket Organizer**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=0.7095261.0.0.7d1d1debU0iJ7G&id=566574700687) | [*Pictures*](https://imgur.com/a/jAO1W) | I'm the same way with wallets that /r/RepLadies is with bags, I love changing them up. I try to have a different wallet every month, and this month I'll be rocking this pocket organizer. Off the bat, the packaging, item number, and UPC all match the item perfectly. The leather quality is very soft, and the card slots are tight like authentic. The interior heat stamp is very well done, and the stitching is extremely clean. This is one of my favorite wallet cops so far this year.\n  \n  \n---  \n  \n[**Aimenpan**](http://qinsh.x.yupoo.com/albums?tab=gallery)  \n[**Amy**](http://amy0419.x.yupoo.com/)  \n[**Believe JB**](http://gwteam82805.x.yupoo.com/)  \n[**ManMan**](http://manmanmore.x.yupoo.com/albums)  \n[**Rick Owens**](http://zb25wt42.x.yupoo.com/)  \n",

And I say that with love - I remember ordering the Blue Neighbourhood CD and listening to it on my long drives to college classes. I commiserated with his sad, gay life while staring out at the gloomy winter weather. He’s always been a boy next door, a wallflower, allowing himself space to make pensive tracks about longing, breakups, or the moments in between, but seemingly apprehensive about taking up space outside of that, leaving the flashy, colorful moments for artists like Charli XCX or Kim Petras.\n\nIt might have to do with where he started. Troye’s career began very early in acting (most notably in the 2009 Wolverine) and spent a lot of time in the public eye with a successful youtube channel and a run singing on various Austrailian telethons and reality shows, and even independently released an [EP of covers](https://troye.fandom.com/wiki/Dare_to_Dream) in 2007. This led to him signing to EMI Australia in 2013, and he released his first major label EP, “[TRXYE](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Trxye)” the following year. It performed significantly well, even sending the single “[Happy Little Pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEWHF3E9YJQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” to the Australian Top 10. He followed it up with another EP, [Wild](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Wild), in 2015.\n\n[Blue Neighbourhood](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Blue-neighbourhood) was his first album, and was preceded with the [Blue Neighborhood Trilogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xCMF7jsDJI&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO), a series of music videos detailing a story of Troye and his love interest growing up together and struggling with their relationship and the world around them. The album was released in December of 2015, and had a dark, synthpop and r&b sound that drew comparisons to Lorde, Halsey, and Sam Smith. It featured Troye’s first Billboard Hot 100 hit “[Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAghEq5Lfw&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” as well as “[Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3awzvNrKDsg&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, which received a [remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8G4oaOxyxk&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO) featuring Alessia Cara. It’s a solid debut, very modern and slick for its time. It didn’t reinvent any wheels, but it also didn’t chase after loud, trendy sounds that many younger artists would have. The songwriting felt strong, even if a bit nonspecific at times. At its worst, Troye leans on aesthetics and gloomy lyrics too heavily, and at its best, you have a song like “[Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VNV__mV38s&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, an intimate look into Troye’s internal struggles with coming out.\n\nTroye then featured on Martin Garrix’s “[There For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNNMr5glICM&ab_channel=MartinGarrix)” in 2017 which was an international hit and scored his second appearance on the Billboard Hot 100. It seemed like the perfect drop to help introduce him to a larger audience as he prepared for his next album, [Bloom](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Bloom). Led off by the first single, “[My My My!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5TqNsr6YuQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, it marked a shift from the soft boy Troye and into something more mature. The album, released in 2018, featured 80’s leaning production, and lyrics that gave more insight into his experience as a young, gay man. Songs like “[Seventeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pxdGNVqwnA&ab_channel=TroyeSivan-Topic)” and “[The Good Side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ay4S61byZo&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” marked an improvement in his lyricism, exploring adult themes and break ups, and even the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PTANtZFW0&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO) was a euphemism for [bottoming](https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/39346/1/troye-sivan-boy-erased-new-album-interview). It was a striking return for Troye, but it still felt restrained: take “[Dance to This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrMAfMbZOmg&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, an Ariana Grande featuring track that bounces along a mellow, mid tempo groove and never allows more than a simple headnod, despite the title suggesting otherwise. Troye always keeps his cool, and the production predictably follows suit.\n\nBy the time we get to his next release, Troye had been featured on soundtracks, done features for alt pop girlies like [Charli XCX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-v1b9waHWY&ab_channel=CharliXCX) and [Allie X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqiNs6tui-o&ab_channel=AllieX), and even had a bonafide worldwide hit in “[I’m So Tired…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvjpE_wFL5A&ab_channel=Lauv)” with up and coming artist Lauv. In 2020, Troye releases [In a Dream](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/In-a-dream-ep), a concept EP that features songs that he wrote during the ending of his Bloom tour, as well as during the ending of his relationship with model [Jacob Bixenman](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/troye-sivan-jacob-bixenman-768x479.png), likening the 7 songs as a time capsule. The EP saw Troye combining experimental dance sounds with indie pop; songs like \"[STUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5clCt1bsE&ab_channel=TroyeSivan-Topic)\" and the back half of “[Take Yourself Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUz2llONqNE&ab_channel=DesertRecords)” featuring heavy bass and techno sounds, while the laid back “[Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCHqIhiFmEY&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” and euphoric “[IN A DREAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cHHnj3xWnw&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” kept some of Troye’s signature earmarks. “Easy” even saw a [re-release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn4XQ9WweRY&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO) as a single featuring a new instrumental from Mark Ronson and a vocal feature from Kacey Musgraves.\n\nThe last few years leading up to Something To Give Each Other saw the release of “[Angel Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyYwOEKKcZc&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, his first song to go viral on TikTok, the lead role in the film “Three Months”, and collaborations with DJs (Regard’s “You” with Tate McRae and PNAU’s “You Know What I Need”). Most notably, in 2023, Troye starred (HBO) Max’s ambitious drama, *The Idol*, alongside The Weeknd and Lily Rose Depp. This show was an edgy, dark take on the everyday life of a popstar, and was written by both The Weeknd and *Euphoria’s* Sam Levinson. It seemed like a promising choice for Troye, as it caught a lot of media buzz when announced, a great stepping stone for Troye before his comeback the same year.\n\n[Something To Give Each Other](https://genius.com/albums/Troye-sivan/Something-to-give-each-other) released on October 13th, a few months out from the summer vibes it seemed to promise. “Rush” and “Got Me Started” were released as singles before, both songs generating a lot of hype for this album. These songs seemed to herald a *different* Troye, someone embracing gay culture head on, someone with a newfound wisdom for his experiences. What we got is honestly Troye at his best (so far). It’s a well curated, well produced, strikingly cohesive, and an expensive sounding project. Most importantly, though, it sounds distinct to Troye, elevating his voice with tasteful dance tracks. His lyricism gets more conversational and personal, showcasing a previously unseen nuance. The album theme centers around heartbreak, connection, and community, exemplified by the title, *Something to Give Each Other,* as in every connection we make, *we give each other something*. During the pandemic, Troye fantasized about being around people and experienced it with new eyes after lockdown ended. It reinvigorated his love for partying, for physicality, and for love (in all its forms). He describes it as writing from a fantasy, as if the party is a religious experience. It’s an especially refreshing take from Troye, a warm and corporeal album, inviting you with every beat, every feeling, every tear, and every drop of sweat.\n\n# TRACK by TRACK\n\n**Rush**\n\n*“I feel the rush*”\n\nA group (of what I imagine would be hunky) men chanting captures your attention immediately as the song kicks off. “*Addicted to your touch*” they add, over a bumping four on the floor beat. Four claps pan across your headphones and we’re off - It’s “[Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53QJYP-lqY&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)”, Troye’s comeback single. After weeks and weeks of heavy teasing on TikTok, the song had reached levels of hype more than any previous Troye song had received before. Partially due to the [ifykyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppers) song title, and a sound that was incredibly different from anything Troye had released, it managed to capture the ears of casual listeners and popheads alike. And it lived up to its hype.\n\nComing in at a short 2 minutes 30 seconds, “Rush” is a commanding house track that’s perfect for summer. Breezy, warm production? Check. Hedonistic lyrics? Absolutely. A chorus that recalls the chanting of [YMCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS9OO0S5w2k&ab_channel=VillagePeople)? *Why the hell not*? It’s Troye embracing a new side of himself - both personally and musically, something that’s refreshing to see from an artist that felt so reserved. Troye knows he’s *thee* go-to twink artist, and he’s ready to make himself at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What’s The Time Where You Are?**\n\nTroye welcomes you with a murmur: “[God, I wish it were you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivdf_W02ucg&ab_channel=TroyeSivan-Topic)”. The hot summer day of “Rush” turns into a hazy night out, and you’re suddenly in Troye’s inebriated headspace. Conversations directed at him are dizzily going in one ear and out the other, his friend exclaims, “Troye, baby, last night was fucking crazy… *what the fuuuuck!*”. It’s a whole vibe, driven by a fat bass, warm pads, and twinkling keys, all while Troye pines for his international love interest. The song was inspired by a text exchange, something that Troye felt was cute; an opening and offering to a conversation. The song reverberates with that feeling of longing, the hazy washes of chatter and synths representing Troye going in and out of the present. “I’m right on top of this groove, *but God I wish it was you*,” he affirms, intoxicated in his fervor. Piano keys accompany Troye on the outro hits like a rush of cool air and his voice feels intensely sober, as if he’s coming out of the club and into the cool, lonely, night air.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One of Your Girls**\n\nThere’s nothing like the music of a gay pining over a straight person. It’s probably one of my favorite genres, something so painfully relatable and hilariously tragic. Troye’s a bit of an expert on this experience, but there’s something that makes “[One of Your Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ0MhGhribE&ab_channel=TroyeSivan)” just *special.* At first listen, it might not seem particularly striking, with a mid tempo beat that chugs alongside some throwback synths. But it’s Troye that completely sells the song, his voice sounding vulnerable and affectionate. “Face card, no cash, no credit” he coos over some delicate guitar strumming, completely enamored by his crush. “*L-Look at you!*” he stutters, taken aback by the man’s beauty. It’s an ode to the straight and curious men he’s had experiences with, recalling texting them to hit him up if they \"feel gay for the weekend\". He tries to make them understand the infatuation they could have, but ultimately he has to meet them at their level: “I’ll be like one of your girls or your homies”. It’s these moments of weakness and relatability that Troye expertly details within the world of gay relationships. These conflicting feelings are mirrored in the song's outro, with the synth lead ([apparently played by Max Martin?](https://www.listnr.com/podcasts/behind-the-hits/episodes/troye-sivan-sex-censorship-self-acceptance)) distorting as Troye’s filtered vocals fill out the space. It’s almost as if he’s conceded to just be his straight friend’s plaything, a hollow robot whenever he gets lonely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In My Room**\n\nWritten about the first boy that broke Troye’s heart, “[In My Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX92lStRfMo&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” is a playful, little, funky tune, detailing his headspace after the breakup as a bedroom. He’s not quite ready to clean up the turmoil and sadness yet, he’d rather keep it “messy”. In line with the subject matter, the production captures the sounds of [bedroom pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGUom_AV4o&ab_channel=ClaireCottrill) (lofi beats and soft, funky basslines) and pairs them with lush, glamorous, strings. The album’s only feature, [Guitarricadelafuente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri02p05A25c&ab_channel=Guitarricadelafuente), details his imagination; flashes of images of his lover and confusing reality with lust and regret. It’s a wonderful pairing, with Troye’s breathier vocals contrasting with Guitarricadelafuerte’s more intimate tone. The song is the gift that keeps on giving, when the outro hits a new high with a key change and Troye singing the title of the album as if it’s a radio tag.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Still Got It**\n\nIf there’s one gripe I have of Troye’s music, it’d be that his ballads have a hard time balancing between genuine regret and mopey sadness. “[Still Got It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OUkc1b-HQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” reeks of the self indulgent ballads of his previous eras, drowning his sorrows in a faux-gospel moment. Organs accompany his woeful lyrics about being coerced into cutting his hair into a bowl cut, with the production reaching a sort of post-blond [Frank Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlz_XHeUUis&list=PLzoqV_VvWIwGzYTcm3r1JwqgQOBXTvKyd&index=15&ab_channel=Blonded) climax. It’s not that he isn’t convincing, but it ultimately feels like an unfortunate slow down after the first four tracks. Maybe that’s its purpose, a sudden realization of what could have been, but when the following track nails the feeling more poignantly, “Still Got It” loses the momentum without giving more emotional voice to make up for it. But for all of the “Got It” fans out there, just know it’s one of Troye’s personal favorites from the album - with him giving it a spotlight in [Live from Spotify’s Green Screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrc68U-DxWc&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can’t Go Back, Baby**\n\n“[Can’t Go Back, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS0e7nRzrUQ&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” is the funeral song for Troye’s past relationship, one that ended due to  his ex cheating on him (or, did he cheat on his ex? i couldn't find a definite answer). Built over a sample of Jessica Pratt’s beautiful “[Back, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3YxJ1OYrVo&ab_channel=JessicaPratt-Topic)”, Troye mourns the relationship as if in real time. It’s a gorgeously melancholic tune, with piano echoing as if pulled from a memory, the warm crackling of a vinyl record, and a soft four by four beat keeping time as the production swells. Troye says that he wrote this song from a place of anger, and while the song details his hurt, it progresses to a place of clarity and regret: “I lay with so much love to take your place”. The song builds beautifully on the tension of a failed relationship, the feeling of tenderness and betrayal of the feelings you still have for someone. All while looking to the morning sun with a newfound love for oneself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Got Me Started**\n\nYou’re greeted by the hook from Bag Raider’s “[Shooting Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MQC_G9jTU&ab_channel=BagRaiders-Topic)”, accompanied by indistinct chatter in the background - like the setting went from mournful morning after to a rooftop party. And what better way to shake off those haunting feelings than with a good time? Troye described this song as “remembering who you are and that people are hot” after “feeling emotionally dead after a traumatic relational experience”. The song commemorates his first crush post break up, detailing unspoken feelings and contains one of the best lyrics on the album: “we should experiment even to the detriment of whoever’s on the couch”. Troye is back.\n\nOn the production side, a song like “[Got Me Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjLcVqjIkLo&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” seems like it would trip over its own design: retooling a meme-y sample seems hardly revolutionary in the world of “[I’m Good (Blue)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90RLzVUuXe4&ab_channel=DavidGuetta)” and [Ava Max](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/olivia-rodrigo-doja-cat-interpolation-music-1220580/)’s discography, while a [2 step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5mEszYqjms&ab_channel=CraigDavidVEVO) beat placement should feel like playing catch up to [PinkPantheress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xVUg9GmDfg&ab_channel=Pinkpantheress) and [NewJeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OMfjwK3X44&ab_channel=Kpillus_MUSIC) more innovative (and influential) uses. But the track takes a more understated approach to allow space for Troye’s relaxed vocals to take center stage - all before cutting out for the “Shooting Star” hook to blister its way into your mind, with Troye’s heavily processed, pitch-shifted vocals harmonizing on the sample to build momentum. One could say it makes you feel like running through the streets of Bangkok in a shiny chrome outfit, like a speedy, twink(ly) disco ball.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Silly**\n\n“[Silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO5SXI-b_dg&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” finds Troye looking for love in the club. It’s an Ian Kirkpatrick-produced track with a muggy, hazy atmosphere and some of the most upfront vocal processing on the album - a choice by Troye to experiment and have fun, a theme that also runs in the lyrics. As he wanders around a party, trying to get out of his head, he downplays his true feelings as “silly” and seeks connections as a way to get further from the rut that he was in post break up. However, he ultimately is a self confessed “love junkie” and can’t push the feelings away. As the track expands into a dizzying, chill, almost [european club tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Z3YrHJ1sU&ab_channel=Spinnin%27Records), his own words echo and fade in and out, never quite letting go of what he really wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Honey**\n\nInspired by the Jewish Serenity Prayer that was taught to him as a child by his father, this is probably the closest Troye gets to taking you to church - or synagogue, rather. “[Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmiBaxJEzuw&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” summons the spacious, uplifting sound of Lorde’s “[Ribs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7pE8AG1jjE&ab_channel=Lorde-Topic)” and dials it up to stadium levels. That was his goal, too - he calls it a “confetti moment” for his live shows. It’s a euphoric house track, with a guitar riff that recalls Janet Jackson’s “[Someone to Call My Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfP5HOIn8vk&ab_channel=JanetJackson-Topic)” and a drop that glistens and distorts, barely containing the overwhelming emotions underneath. “I see love in every space,” declares Troye, drunk on the honey of the music, lust, and connection between the two. “Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to,” he sings. The chorus swoops in, with Troye praying to a higher power for strength to communicate his feelings, but it’s not pleading, it’s joyous. This loss for words is a privilege, maybe it’s a fleeting feeling, but maybe it doesn’t need to be said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How To Stay With You**\n\n“[How To Stay With You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGXll5TIOEk&ab_channel=TroyeSivanVEVO)” is the much deserved victory lap that closes the album. The song is warm like an embrace, thanks to its relaxed tempo, funky bass and keys (courtesy of A. G. Cook). Troye ruminates over his crush, and the excitement of a blossoming relationship. “I feel like my mother might like you, just not in the same way I do” he teases in a sing-songy melody. There’s a genuine feeling of affection throughout this song, even when he sings “turn my bussy out”. Even if there’s an underlying uncertainty in the lyrics, we finally see Troye excited at the prospect of a new relationship, a new optimism springing up. It’s nostalgic and chill, the sort of song that will have you slow dancing while the sax solo plays you into the morning light.\n\n# The Twinkprint\n\n“*Something to Give Each Other*” was quite the success for Troye - although if you’re comparing success according to some chart or sales metrics, you might not find too many impressive stats. But I’m not talking about numbers, what Troye did was far more important than that. Similar to [Carly Rae Jepsen](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/)’s or [Charli XCX’](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charli-xcx-pop-2/)s careers, he focused on artistic integrity by curating a cohesive album, all the while using visuals to create conversations leading up to the release. This is an impressive feat for Troye, an artist who seemed destined to never stray from his comfort zone. Whether it was [viral choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk0XlOmc8lQ&ab_channel=asdfghelimar), overt gay themes ([glory hole](https://us.troyesivanstore.com/products/rush-exclusive-limited-glory-edition-7) cam?!), or crossdressing and giving [Ross Lynch a lap dance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WYt2C_40iDg), Troye expertly navigated the pop space through generating buzz, hyping older fans and piquing the curiosity of casual listeners. And more importantly, he pulled it off almost effortlessly, never blinking twice at experimenting with sounds or image. This is never clearer than in the album art, his head nestled between a nude man’s legs, his face in open laughter. Troye shared that he was self conscious and he didn’t smile for all of the photoshoot until his friend tickled him. It's a great look into Troye’s experiences and new worldview, a growth that I hope to see him build upon in future releases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4 Questions that We Can Give Each Other\n\n* Were you familiar with Troye’s music before this album, and if so, did this change your opinion of him as an artist?\n* If *Something to Give Each Other* got a remix album, which artists would you like to see on what tracks?\n* Where would you like to see Troye take his music in the future? Any particular genres or sounds you wish he’d explore?\n* This album experiences (particularly queer) community through music and partying, are there any other albums you feel do the same?",

I was a minor fan before this (loved Easy (Remix), Angel Baby, and a few other songs) but in the past year I’ve been diving deeper into his discography and have fallen in love with it (he’s actually shot up to my third most played artist ever, only behind Beyoncé and Carly Rae Jepsen). He’s an artist who shows growth with every single project and that don’t stop here. It’s *so* gay, but mature and unexpected. None of the songs (bar Still Got It) sound like anything else he’s done, the lyrics are fun and interesting, and the visuals this era have been nothing short of perfect. \n\nI’m so happy he received his first Grammy nominations for Rush and can’t wait to hear what he does next. In the meantime this album is still on regular rotation for me (especially the final 3 songs, imo the best 3 song run of the year). I’m sure he can still top this album ~~and me~~ but if he doesn’t this will surely be looked at as his magnum opus",

If you aren’t already doing this for a living I’d suggest looking into it! \n\nBefore I jump into the questions, I’ll add that I really appreciate the way he plays with sound on this album. Some of my favorite examples: \n\n- The post-chorus on “Rush” sounds wobbly like you just ummm engaged with the poppers. \n\n- The computerized voice on “One of your girls” feels indicative that the conversations/interactions in question are happening electronically over text or even some social media platform as opposed to in person. \n\n- The outro on “Still Got It” uses all these electronic sounds, which seems to indicate that his response to not being over his ex is to get on Grindr or one of the other apps and start endlessly scrolling to find someone to help him get over it.\n\nNow onto the questions: \n\n1. I was familiar but not interested lol. Never heard anything that made my ears perk up like this. This definitely changed my opinion! The artistry is just so immediate and apparent. \n\n2. Queer people only! Katrynada, Sam Smith, Kim Petras, Janelle Monae, Lil Nas X, Adam Lambert, Pabllo Vittar, hell I’d even take a select few of the drag race gwarls. \n\n3. I rarely have thoughts/opinions about where artists should go next. That’s up to them. \n\n4. Renaissance and The Age of Pleasure experience community through music/partying, also with a specific lens on (Black) Queerness. It’s been so exciting to have so much music brought to us by Queer people, for Queer people recently. It’s a beautiful reminder of how special the Queer community is. Most other cultures exist due to people who are in proximity to one other, but Queer culture exists worldwide, and is communicated not only through common experiences, but common language, common sounds, and common feelings, and that’s beautiful!",

The bits of his stuff I've heard that predates that stuff aren't really my thing. But the big moment of \"Rush\" got me tuned into that song and I absolutely love it, one of my fave songs from last year. Overall I really like this album, it's both a lot of fun and seems sincere. Plus it seems really lovingly made.\n2. Everyone else before me has already mentioned great queer artists who'd be great on the remix album. Troye is already showing indie kid tendencies between working with Jay Som and sampling Jessica Pratt so I think a Perfume Genius collab would be fun. Also an interview between the two of them would probably be chaotic and a lot of fun.\n3. I hope his future albums have at least one very pop, very camp banger like \"Rush\" on them\n4. Janelle's album from last year comes to mind.\n\nThanks for this writeup! It's so great, love the effort and detail you put into it!",

Still Got It is often a skip for me but even that's not a bad song and the rest is very strong. I think my favorites at this point are What's the Time Where You Are and Honey, but as is the hallmark of my favorite albums my favorite tracks switch around so much that most of the tracks have been considered my favorites at some point.",

All of his singles have great videos and I've been bumping them since they came out.\n2. I'm not sure, but queer artists only please! \n3. I liked this album of his, but haven't checked out his other music yet. I'd love a continuation of this sound.\n4. Not entirely a party album, but Chappell Roan's album also gives me similar vibes. \"After Midnight\" and \"Pink Pony Club\" come to mind immediately. Troye's album and Chappell's are probably my fave albums of 2023.",

I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, \"The money printer is back on!\" \"We're destined for astronomical gains!\" \"S&P $5000, here we come!\" \"There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,\" and so on.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEwwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recap :**\n\nSeason 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let’s first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Oct 2nd week: We called this the bottom and we went max long. And we absolutely nailed it.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nov 2nd week: When SPX hit its target of above $4k I told everyone to sell their tactical positions and start building short positions but not to go all in and short level by level. I was sure that Q1 2023 was going to be a disaster.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nov 4th week: I was absolutely convinced that after “Thanksgiving dinner SPX $4100” markets will start marching towards its $3200 target. Little did I know about the consequences of my decision and what a horrible mistake will that turn out to be.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Last week of December: I was coming back from my vacation and I was so happy that SPX was trading around $3800. I thought this was it the “Minsky moment” shall arrive anytime now. But unfortunately, it never did. So high Vix Jan never happened.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Last week of Jan: I reanalyzed things after SPX again went for $4100 and every time I did my calculations were always pointing to this Q1 disaster that no one really was positioning for.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Feb 19: On my birthday I had to write another newsletter convincing everyone that March was 100% going to be a disaster and SPX shall be trading at $3200 because of this double top pattern. Now that I look back I should’ve known better than that  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>“Fuck your puts, Fuck your calls  \n>  \n>Hopping like a kangaroo, your inverse portfolio falls”  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>March 3rd week: I wrote my final Newsletter titled S02E08 about the Banking crisis Recession and I came up with the two most basic and simplest theories. Either you crash right now with a bear flag breakdown pattern or use the invalidation case called bear stern exit liquidity ie. crash 9 weeks later with an H&S pattern. I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Learning from our Mistakes :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\- Never try to time markets  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Never ever forget the above rule coz even though you time markets with a perfect date it doesn’t do anything. ( Learned it in Season 1 )  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Markets can go sideways for a long time and hence be irrational longer than you can remain insolvent.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Don't underestimate the power of the Federal Reserve.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Start making models and AI algos with ChatGPT you moron.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let’s analyze things from a new perspective and let’s see what markets are trynna tell us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experiment :** \n\n**\"Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.\n\nSo let’s build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let’s just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let’s just deep dive right in.\n\n*-> a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUSA :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=b05ebb5819bf88cb279bed69301ed5894cc1dcfb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a “Negative correlation” and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of “Negative correlation” But then inflation happened and that’s why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in “Positive correlation” i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the “Negative correlation” where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the “Banking crisis” where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It’s one of the chapters of the “Recession playbook” that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=64984830b3ad6047e100764820ae750ab2d5737e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean for us?\n\nWell in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a “negative correlation” of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.\n\nAs for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: “We are still in a strong Positive correlation” of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJapan & Germany :\n\nSo now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still \"Negatively correlated\" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that’s when a “Positive correlation” emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b85d2033c3123709169c7cde4698b847d094616)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8ae9b3d01dcc83ce5be7acda760d95618f8d0c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult:  Inconclusive result.\n\nWe should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn’t just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn’t everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7d80b39c1396a19765b492eeb8710562c78686c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*->  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEurusd-De10y :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b789c29d0f117f25fb9640a3acd38b723c7df86d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don’t get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don’t wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f’ed then I am hoping Europe will get f’ed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It’s the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like “What are you talking man” “I am more confused” and “Just tell me up or down” Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=6defc908dd263d097745c8d10aefd250776307d5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let’s not assume anything. It’s still not clear. We need more data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGbpUsd - Gb10y\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=156688ea0516138600c999ceb9a2a9590c6d8cac\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad69cd1b1b7cc212ead4f32d62953cf1cbefb0b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsdJpy - Jp10y :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=da7156736874bfcec1619b800792abcb0200eed8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=a35187965efcf8bc62fa41c2255194f2424ecae4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDXY - Us 10y\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fowy356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec823092ae0cf5ec64bd72bfcc521595604ad78\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let’s check the daily time frame to show what I mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5xybeoxjc5b1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f3f54b6ea5b205ca213b640b07d5bd1f89b3551\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Monthly time frame b\\/w currencies and bond yields.](https://preview.redd.it/fpsy6cqxjc5b1.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5272a07fbe0480f4c9f5fcf3e6e8d1141081438)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBalance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3457b82986724c4bdd014d48085ccb79e0f39e8f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can clearly see till October every CB’s were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) \n\nNow some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8nw1coxjc5b1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=5050d871bf552f06c1ea19652a935a89abad06b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 1: Deflationary spiral\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|\n|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|\n|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 1.1%|or|Down|\n|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|\n|5. October|\\-ve Gdp|\\-ve %|\\> 4%|God knows|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, inflation is high :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: +ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut soon inflation will go low :\n\nSo, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: -ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -> Dxy will shoot up -> Stocks will go down eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime taken :\n\nNormally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this \"Inverse them bruh\" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )\n\nThis trade can also begin early if you have inflation > 4.3% in June or > 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|\n|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|\n|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\\> 3.2%|or|Down|\n|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\\> August|Govt wants|Down a lot|\n|5. October|God knows|God knows|\\> 4%|God knows|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, inflation is high :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: +ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then inflation will go higher :\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: still +ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 2a & 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- 2b) Let’s say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?\n\nAns: Japan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ea0u6eoxjc5b1.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2e5ba345dfb84669439566eca6cabc846368a9a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJapan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where is the Butterfly effect theory that you promised?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khvkbohkud5b1.jpg?width=1495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=456463e080c9ba534e430b4650b37be54b81f0fc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you \" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position :** \n\n [https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC\\_9\\_L](https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC_9_L) \n\nSorry, my image limit got hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts :**\n\nThe real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy the weekend everyone. \n\nSee you guys next week!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegards\n\nGabimaru\n\n( You got a problem with that? Heck even Tate is into anime girls now xD )",

      "desc": "Imagine, one day you wake, birds a chirpin, winds not blowing, Sunshine, as far as you can see. For the first time in your adult life, as a drone enthusiast like many of us, you're awake before 9am. (I know that's why I said imagine) and the day and countless third party apps you use to determine if the day is a good day for some flying, all give you the green light. Encouraging you to go fly. And well, that's exactly what we do. Go fly. We find the perfect spot to launch from. And everything is going so perfectly.........until it's not...All of the sudden you can't help but feel that something is not right, and you look up to see the your Mavic Mini has indeed become what can only be described as self aware, and it Flys every so majestically into the burning gaze of the solar rays along the horizon, never to be seen again. You begin to feel upset at the $300 item of a very expensive hobby, just coasts away in the sunset, like some cheap 80s movie ending where the bad guy wins and drives off with your girl. But then you remember \"I bought DJI care Refresh for that thing, I'm good!\" Which you actually are not. And I know I'm not the only person that will experience this so here's the inside trader tips, and advice from a customer who's been FUCKED by yet another company. And made to believe my dreams were nothing short of fairy tales.\n\nAnyone who has experienced flyaways or drones just breaking their owners hearts and running away, of this extremely expensive hobby, will tell you, that when it happens, because they do and they can, and for a large number of us will. That the feeling is nothing shy of literally sheer sadness. DJI was the first company to give its customers peace of mind though with the DJI Care Refresh. And coverage for flyaways for this particular situation. However, this applies to every DJI drone but three. FPV, Akata, and the Mavic Mini. This wouldn't be a problem for the first two. But for the Mavic Mini it is. Because this drone is said by staff to not even be sold anymore, yet any resolution to an ordeal with DJI will result in the following offer. 1. MAVIC MINI WITHOUT CONTROLLER. 2. AND A 40% DISCOUNT. ending with a grand total of right around $200 ($202.20 USD for the people who need exact amounts) and will he pushed to by or extend DJI care Refresh for it. Which for almost any replacement drone, requires you to send in the old one. Kinda hard to do if yours flyaway. However, more situation may be currently unique but not because I'm the first it's happened too, as I believe more than 1 person out there has been made to believe they were offered a great deal for their flyaway case. Until they find out they weren't. I bought an SE and when it fell from sky, I was returned a Mini because it was of equal value then the SE as I purchased mine and had received some kinda discount. I'm not entirely sure, but it ended up being equal in price. Upon doing so. And beijg offered what seemed to be a respectable offer, I was pushed to extend my DJI care Refresh for the Mini, and was told it was covered under flyaways. After mine decided to go back and eliminate John Connor, and embark on its mission. I find out it's not. And am offered the deal mentioned before as a resolution which I took. On two separate occasions. Before learning it was not covered. Today. I'm told the product is so old they don't even sell it anymore but am also told All drones are covered by DJI CARE Refresh. All drones besides the Akata and FPV. There is no mention of the Mini what so ever. The one drone that gets offered as a resolution drone to customers. What are the opinions of my good friends here on Reddit? Am I in the wrong for any complaints?",

And I even paid full price. I was credited nothing back from this and most likely won't be. But it wasn't about the money. It's about companies deliberately keep out of date information on their pages or in their trainee courses. Because they know idiots like me will buy it under the assumption it applies to the item in question. It's not 100% the reps fault either. I'd say 40% is because she has the ability and resources to update her own information. And having worked for DJI before. I know that's something they expect employees to do. But they don't inform employees of the changes",

After flying lipo powered traditional FPV drones, the Avata 2 is actually harder to fly since you have very little power reserve. \n\nI would like to keep the RC3 for teaching my Girl how to fly her Neo and eventually on to a more traditional FPV. This leaves me with the Avata 2 flymore pack sans the goggles. \n\nWhile this is no longer a complete package, it looks like DJI is routinely sold out of the drone only, leading me to believe people want backups or maybe there are just that many people without Care in their country. \n\nAny suggestions for selling it? I haven’t even posted it on Fb market place as I try to go through friends who have traditional drones. Seems like with the n3 goggles, someone could pick up a good deal on a complete Avata 2 set up. I would like to see a certain figure it for it, and I don’t think I’m willing to buy n3 goggles to sell it until I see some other listings in that manner. \n\nMods please don’t remove this post. While eventually I plan to sell my Avata, I will not be promoting it here. I have not completely decided to sell it, but I am leaning that way. ",

      "title": "Customer got a bent iPhone XS Max out of the box...",
      "desc": "Hey ya'll. Figured i need to post it somewhere, so this seems like a place for it. \n\nFor a bit of a backstory, i work in tech retail store in eastern europe(not gonna post my country just in case) thats mostly based on selling photography stuff like cameras, lenses and all that. But we do sell also dji stuff and all, also some Apple products, like iPhones which are represented in the store by some variety.\n\nSo the story starts about a week or two ago, a nice young couple came and wanted to buy an iPhone XS Max which was about 1300 euros. They had bought a GoPro Hero 7 and Fitbit Versa watch also from us previously. Now they wanted an iPhone and to use postpay or lease or whatever its called in english. Basically, all was well, contract was made to the girls name and that was that....or so i thought. \n\nNow, im no apple fan....i dont like anything they do, sell or create. Not gonna write the reasons, would be too lengthy. The thing is, the same boy came back the next day with something i have never seen before. A BENT IPHONE FROM THE BOX!!! Here are the pictures(it has a screen protector on also at that moment): [https://imgur.com/BTbakNF](https://imgur.com/BTbakNF) [https://imgur.com/O7ng46I](https://imgur.com/O7ng46I)\n\nYou can see it on the pictures barely, better in real life, but the phone has turned into a slightly curved banana. Now i checked every corner and edge, and it did not have any signs that it was dropped or anything, the screen was still perfectly glued to the body, which means it wasnt manhandled. Still, it could be done with hands but the strength you have to use for it is ridiculous. Its a steel frame and shouldnt bend or be bent like that, especially out of box as a new product. The guy was pissed a lil bit, but we handled it and it went into service to see if we can replace it to a new one. I took it myself to the apple store right across from our store and told them what the problem was first hand. Now they were as astonished as i was. They took the phone, and that was it...\n\nFew days later, that was not my shift, it was brought back to my store, and when i read what was written by apple tech employee i thought honestly, WTF! It said something along the lines: the user has done this damage, also cant give money back or replace because the phone was turned on.... Well, wtf indeed. I went back to apple store to clear this up, they said the man, who i know, who had looked and written this wasnt working that day. Few days later he was and when the customer, who i kept in touch with, went to ask again about the phone, what apple said really made me mad. \n\nThey said: WE CANT REPLACE IT OR GIVE MONEY BACK BECAUSE THAT WOULD HURT THE REPUTATION OF APPLE!\n\nExcuse the french, but what kind of a fucking company does this? I now know the customer has filed a report to the Consumer Protection Board and i actually encouraged him also, bcs its either apple or my company who has to do something about it. There should be a video also of the customer opening the iphone and showing it bent out of the box, i havent seen it yet, but im fully convinced that a young boy wouldnt just fake this especially only a day after and especially bcs he got another iphone xs max from a different store in the meanwhile because he needed a phone to use. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, any commentary or similar experiences??",

I don't believe he bent the phone himself, if it was the first day most sane people will treat their brand new phones like new born babies.",

He already bought a new iphone from somewhere else, and since this bent one is under contract, all he wants is to return it, because otherwise he has to pay every month for something that he doesnt need. He only made the first payment, nothing else, it wasnt large, sub 50 euro.  Why would anyone get so tangled up in such things if they are not telling the truth? Its not america here...",

I heard so many fairytales from customers how they opened a box and whatever happened to a phone (I remember one guy came with totally smashed phone and was telling me it was like that when he opened the box...aha). But it was word to word. If he opened the box at the store, there could be something we could do about it (if it was thruth). But if the person didn't open it in front of us, it was his/her fault (me as a customer - I would open it and check it)\n\nImagine if some customer really does something like that on purpose...maybe because at home they figured out that they don't want to pay the contract, or maybe they found the phone somewhere else cheaper. Some people get crazy ideas - just like bending phones and saying \"oh it was like that when I opened the box\" thinking it will be easier to get money back.\n\nAnd you mentioning USA - if this situation you mentioned happened in the USA, I'm sure they could just yell for a while at the retailer and would get a free replacement - this is how it works in the USA. They can return anything at very strange situations.\n\nbtw - I think you're getting way too personal about your customer situation. it's their problem, not yours. chill out 😀\n\nWhat I would recommend to you for you next time selling a device to your future customers - ask the customer if they wants to open it and check it after selling it. Just so you can be sure about yourself that it is not your fault. That's what I always did. And if they came back to me like - YOU SOLD IT TO ME - I always knew I was asking, if they didn't want to look - their problem.",

The typical US retailer will do an exchange within the return period if the device is undamaged, pass that matter off to Apple if outside of that window, and do absolutely nothing with a damaged device (unless the person purchased a warranty such as Apple Care).  BTW, unless you have an iPhone shipped to you, or you purchased from a third party retailer, it is almost impossible to purchase a new iPhone in the US without it being opened by the retailer or carrier. Spewing anti-American fairy tales, based upon some garbage you read online, hardly strengthens your point.",

      "title": "Looking for a new job; if you hear about an opening, please let me know.",
      "desc": "I have two jobs. Or, had. I'm pretty sure I'll quit both of them after what happened last night.\n\nDuring the  day, I’m a plumber. Whenever I enter a home, I scan it for valuable  stuff. Jewelry, electronics... whatever I can sell.\n\nYesterday morning, I entered the Collins’ house. I greeted Mrs. Collins, a chipper housewife with an “I want to speak to the manager” haircut, and let her lead me through the house right to the master bedroom. The en suite bathroom, she explained to me on our way up the stairs, had smelled horrible for the last couple of days. They suspected the smell  came out of the pipes.\n\nI  nodded patiently, letting out the occasional grunt to assure her I was listening. Nice paintings on the walls, bedroom with two kids’ beds, and  I think I caught sight of a DJI Phantom drone, carelessly left on the  brightly colored rug. Those babies cost over a thousand bucks. Yep, I was coming back.\n\nThe  master bedroom was a little bit messier than I had expected. Some  pieces of bright red lingerie were flung over a chair (Note: used  panties sell like sliced bread) and the bed was all rumpled, with  pillows almost tumbling down to the floor. I chuckled a little. Looks  like Mr and Mrs Collins had had quite the night.\n\nAfter inspecting the bathroom (which indeed had a foul smell to it), I quickly figured out what the problem was. The odor was emitting from the sink, which probably hadn’t been cleaned properly in years. So I gave the pipes a good, thorough cleaning, and trotted back downstairs.\n\nMrs  Collins was busying herself in the kitchen and barely glanced up when I  came to stand in the doorway. I shortly explained to her what had been  done and told her she would receive the bill in the mail.\n\n“Great, thank you so much” she said, barely looking up from her crock pot and smiling like she’d just stepped into duck shit.\n\nI lingered for a second, letting my gaze drift across the room. My eyes fell on four tickets, pinned to the refridgerator.\n\n“So you’re going to the circus tonight?” After she shot me a confused look, I pointed at the tickets. “Brumbleberry Family Circus. I’ve been there a couple of times with my kid. It’s a great show!” I didn’t have a kid, of course.\n\n“Oh. Yeah, we’re very excited about it. Family trip”, Mrs Collins replied with that same forced smile.\n\nEight hours later I returned to their house. As expected, everything was dark and silent. Perfect.\n\nI went through my usual routine and soon found myself standing in their hallway. This gig was a breeze. I made my way through the house, up the stairs and debated on which room to take first. I finally settled on the master bedroom, to get the jewelry and the lingerie.\n\nMore  out of habit, I opened the door slowly, listening intently to my surroundings. You never know, right? Nothing was to be heard, so I pushed it open all the way. And proceeded to let out the biggest fucking  yelp that has ever left my mouth.\n\nMrs  Collins and what I assume was her husband weren’t at the circus. They were in their beds. Her in the lingerie I had seen earlier, and him in some plaid pajamas. But the pajamas weren’t the most terryfing thing.\n\nThey  were both sitting upright in bed, their heads turned towards me, and smiling. Not that horror movie, unnaturally wide grin. No, just a regular smile. It seemed sincere.\n\nWith a pounding heart and barely being able to pull myself out of my stupor, I held up my hands.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry, I thought you were... Tell you what, I’ll just...” I stopped abruptly as I noticed that there  was no reaction whatsoever. Just this... very upright position, and  that *smile*. God, I can’t get it out of my head. It was as if they knew  exactly who I was. As if they’d been waiting for me. Happy that I  finally came. I don’t know how else to describe it.\n\nSuddenly  I felt very cold. Whatever was going on  here wasn’t normal, and it sure as hell wasn’t right. You know that  feeling of impending doom you sometimes get? Especially in the middle of  the night, after you’ve watched a horror movie and need to go to the  bathroom? That feeling that if you get up and leave your bed now, you’re  gonna regret it badly?\n\nIt took me only seconds to make the decision. I had to get the fuck out of here.\n\nI  snapped out of my trance and spun around to race back through the  hallway – only to be faced with the two Collins kids, standing inches  away from me. A boy and a girl, maybe between four and eight years old, I  don’t know. Holdings hands and just standing there, smiling at me. As if I was their favorite uncle who’d come to visit, or Santa Claus, or  Barney. The girl was wearing some kind of Disney princess nightgown, and the boy’s pajamas were a miniature version of his dad’s.\n\nJust for a moment, I held my breath. I don’t know, I think was waiting for them to say something. *Anything*.\n\nBut they didn’t. They just stood there, smiling happily.\n\nAgain,  I told myself that if I had to be the poor chap in the first five minutes of Supernatural, I at least wouldn’t be as stupid and try to find out what’s going on. So finally, finally I snapped out of it and ran like a mad man. Anything to get out of this place.\n\nI  almost couldn’t believe it when I jumped into my car and sped away. I was sure they’d come after me, that they wouldn’t just let me get away. But no, I got home safely. No police, no crazy family waiting for me.\n\nBy the time morning came around and I dared to leave the safety of my bed, I had a message from my boss on my phone.\n\n*Chad, you been to Colorado Drive yesterday, right? Mrs Collins called and said they want you to come back, they still got the smell problem and want you to clean all pipes in teh house. Let me know when your done. Thx.*\n\nWell, fuck.",

Now I had no intention of upgrading as it's a perfectly good phone, so I just wanted to ask if anyone is aware of a work around? Apparently the older version of GO was compatible, would it still work?\n\nCheers.\n\nEdit: thank you for all of your replies, after reading through them all I gave in and upgraded my phone as well, As pointed out multiple times it's worth it to get the most out of the drone, not to mention as much as I love my old phone, she's redundant now and the time has come to sell the old girl. iPhone 6s is on the way (aux jack plus cost beat out the iPhone 7) as I was concerned with the performance issues mentioned with android, I'll stick with iOS a few more years it seems!\n\nThanks again, see you in the skies shortly.

If you want the keep your phone's form factor but want support for at least another ~4 years, I suggest getting an iPhone SE.  The 64GB iPhone SE is only $18.74 a month with a 2 year payment agreement from Verizon ($450 outright).\n\nI don't recommend switching to an Android device.  The DJI Go app has crashed multiple times on my Moto Z Force Droid running Android 7.0.  It's not a fun feeling when you lose control of your drone only to look down and see a message saying \"DJI Go has stopped responding, Close App or Wait?\"  My Phantom 4 has returned home every time this happened (or at least started the process) but it's still scary.  I never had that issue with my iPhone 6S.  It's bad enough that, with my Spark coming in (and me wanting to only use my phone to control it), I'm thinking about paying my phone off early and getting an iPhone 7 now.  I don't think I can trudge through another 4-6 months waiting for the iPhone 8.",

No contact was not that hard because she blocked me from anywhere.\n\nI did a lot of activities to get through this.\n\n* Started weightlifting, the progresive overload makes you feel way better along time. Confidence got back\n* Started tae kwon do lessons.\n* Went on a diet, lost 45 pound of weight, now I am 10% bodyfat, almost getting ripped\n* Went on lessons of stuff I wanted to learn about my job, therefore got promoted.\n* Started two businesses\n* Went on a trip\n* I am learning about photo and video.\n\nI know it sounds materialistic, but got a lot of new things I always wanted but could not afford before.\n\n* Bigger apartment, this was funny because I learn some much about house maintenance, learned how to install drywalls, install AC, plumbering electricity, wood, painting, etc. And even funnier is the fact that the internet was shitty here, so i decided to make something to bring internet to the area and sell it to my neighbours, now i am a WISP.\n* Samsung 50\" 4KTV\n* DJI Mavic pro, this was funny too, because it was from a friend who broke it and i learned to fix them (I work with computers so is not that different) and started a business to fix drones.\n* GoPro Hero 7 Black\n* 20TB NAS server for my footage\n* and my next step is to get a mirrorless camera and a new car (or restore a classic car, still not decided)\n\nDuring this time I met so many beatiful girls and connected with a lot of them. For a long moment I completely forgot about my ex. Until two days ago. She popped up in the Suggested friends list on Facebook, my inmediate reaction was to block her.But that got me thinking, ¿Why if we can make it work this time? ¿What would she say if she sees where i am today? ¿Where have she been?. My rational mind tells me not to talk to her, my emotional mind tells me to.\n\nAt the beginning tought that all of this was possible because of her, but then i tought it was not because of her, it was because she dump me, so there is no reason to be greatful with her. All the improvements I have done are for me and not for her. So sticked to the plan of letting her go, the issue is that the next day I had a nightmare with the day we broke up and now i cant stop thinking about her and almost all the tought i have about her are \"what if?\" \"what would?\"I kind of feel like going back at the beginning, no motivation and no reasons to get to my daily routine, stopped being productive, and its been just 3 days. So, if you have an idea or you have been in the same situation, let me know that did you do to keep going, because i feel really shitty and i am listening sad music as before, kind of feel like i want to cry while writing this, still dont know what went wrong between us two but i really tought i forgot about it because i ignore it this whole time. Am I that weak?",

Now that I need to do things like motion graphics/audio mastering I'm finding I've hit a wall, and I cant afford to pay anyone to help me. How did you get over this inevitable hurdle? Its one thing to grab a camera and shoot, but the part where you need to survive to finish it is something else entirely.|I hit that wall also. What I did was, I edited the first 30 mins of the film into a sort of extended sizzle. Music, basic coloring etc....just what I could do myself. I then it to people who fell in love with the project and agreed to continue on with backpay.\n[deleted]|Find a subject or subject matter that really interests you. Then do a little research on cameras (most iphones are now 4k) and go out and do it. It really is that easy, and can be done for almost no money.\n |Watch youtube tutorials, learn to edit (easier then it sounds), and go knock on some doors. You can always go back to the rat race :) DM me, I would love to keep chatting and lure someone else out of the ratrace.\nHow did you deal with getting it into festivals or what was your process of distribution like?|That was certainly an experience. I was a first-time director and our small team was also pretty green, so we were unable to play the politics/name game. So we did blind submissions to the A/B tier ones and crossed our fingers.\n |Luckily we got into Slamdance and won the grand jury and it all snowballed from there. We also got a distribution deal at Slamdance.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nThat’s awesome. I am currently working on my own documentary and am truly inspired.|Cool! Hit me up on instagram if you have further questions about the fest scene etc.\nVery inspiring! The hardest part for me is when we have to get the film out there. How did you plan for release?|Thank you!\n |We knew we had a great film but getting it out there was really tough for us as well. We didn't really have a plan or any money, so we just blindly applied to the major fests and got lucky with Slamdance. I would NOT recommend that to any first-time filmmakers.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nAwesome! And yeah makes sense with those big fests. To follow up, do they then set you up with broadcast/streaming or is that a whole other pitch you need to make?|There are a lot of details but simply, the road we went down:\n |Festivals, approached by sales agents at fests, get good press/screenings at fest, choose best sales agent, sales agent takes it from there.\nWhat city was it? You somehow neglected to mention it in your blurb and I’m feeling dickish|Good catch. Camden, NJ.\nIm a teacher myself and am curious, did being in that profession influence/inspire your drive to make this documentary and, if so, did it aid in your ability to make such a successful documentary?|Yeah, I taught adults (night class) in Barcelona and that really helped me down the line with confidence in interviews. If you believe it, they believe it.\n |I don't think the teaching profession lead me to doc film but teaching abroad and the travels that ensued certainly opened my eyes to other cultures and made me even more curious. And I started making travel films with one of the first go-pros, which was probably the original seed that brought me here.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nVery cool. Thank you for putting yourself on the line to help address such a serious issue. And thank you for responding. Peace and love.|Thanks for stopping by and for the questions\nI'm not sure if you're still answering questions but there's a film I've always wanted to make (I won't bore you with the details), but knowing how niche of an audience it would attract I have never delved in to it as I know it would be a money and time pit. But, seeing how you walked away from teaching to dive in to making your film, I'm feeling adventurous again. I'm curious though, what provisions did you have in place, if any, for if the whole thing went to shit? And while you were traveling and filming, what was something that came up that you wish you'd have planned for? I'll be watching your film this weekend, so thanks for posting!|I'll be here all night, as the world burns ;) I didn't have any plan B, no. Which is why I think I was able to make the jump out of teaching. I guess I could have gone back to teaching, or writing, but I never really thought about those as options.\n |Something that came up while traveling and filming that I wish I planned for? Well I didn't plan for anything, so everything was a surprise. I guess I should have known how hard it would be to try to start a travel show with your (now ex) gf, with no money, or real plan. Ahh to be younger and in lust. ..\n |Sorry, losing my mind. Thanks for the support I hope you like the film!\nJust watched the trailer and looking forward to watching the entire thing! If you're still answering questions I have a few technical questions at the tip of my brain: 1) What apertures did you find yourself shooting in a majority of the time? Especially curious about your approach to low light scenes. 2) Speaking of low-light, what was your preferred method of dealing with SLOG noise in the shadows? 3) Did you lean on the A7SII autofocus much during this shoot? Have a lovely day!|The A7sii is amazing in low light and I of course tried to shoot at as low of an aperture as possible. But the majority of the time I shot at F8 and also used a great adjustable ND.\n |For slog noise I keep fstop as low as it goes and keep the ISO down as much as possible. I then like to add a tiny bit of external light, whether that's a door cracked or an iphone light off to the corner of the room.\n |I leaned on autofocus while I learned the camera, as it was one more thing to worry about when I legit had no idea how to film. You can see some focus pulls that were NOT intentional but now ppl think were an artistic choice haha. As I gained confidence, I went to manual.\n ^(the below has been split into three)|\nFrom a photographer would like to venture toward photojournalism/editorial 1. How did you build trust with the subjects?|They sort of just let me in from the start (that motel scene at the beginning of the movie was my first night with \"the group\") They all provided me with an incredible amount of trust and eventually it was almost like they didn't even notice me sitting there with a camera after a while. I think for a city like Camden, and especially for those suffering from addiction, they feel ignored/forgotten and the camera finally gives them some agency back.\n2. Did you have contacts before going on or did you just go in blind?|I didn't have any contacts and went in blind.\n3. What was the most difficult part throughout the whole process?|I think the most difficult part was having to sit back while people destroyed their lives. Especially when that also deeply effected others, such as their children and unborn babies. Those were certainly the toughest parts to film and still stick with me today.\n ^(the below has been split into two)|\nI guess I have a cpl questions: 1. What got you interested in addiction itself— and filming it? Did you experiment with them at some point in your life, or had loved ones to be affected by drugs, maybe?|I didn’t set out to make a story about heroin or street drugs, and in fact, it didn't start out as a story about the opioid epidemic at all, but rather the fall and fallout of a post-industrial America. I would still go so far as to say it’s more a film about love and addiction, projected onto a backdrop of a post-industrial city struggling with the current epidemic.\n2. Do you have any opinions on the drug war? (do you think drugs should be decriminalized?)|The drug war is a complete failure, and yes, I would push for a similar model to that which Portugal has implemented with great success. Let's see what happens in Oregon.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nTy so much for your insight. Plan to see your film and I hope a lot of others do too! Good luck and Godspeed in life!!!|Thank you! And thanks for the support.\nHave you ever used Heroin/opioids? If not did you ever feel tempted while making the documentary?|I never have used them, no. And never felt the urge to while filming.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nThanks. I have difficulty watching these types of things because of past addictions. I make it through but it puts me in a difficult head space.|Understood completely :)\nWhere can I watch in the UK?|Our UK release is coming soon! Some people on this thread have had luck with VPNs.\nHey there! As someone quite familiar with Camden and just now seeing this AMA, I wanted to ask why you chose Camden specifically for this?? Also having spent the time that you did both in this city and on the issue, what are your thoughts and feelings about Camden as a city, and legalization of drugs in a broad & general sense?? Looking forward to watching!|My father and his side of the family is from Camden, NJ, although they left in the 70s. They all remained in the general area and they have so many good/bad stories about Camden so it's always been a place that I've wanted to explore.\n |Also, I didn't have a budget and Camden was close enough where I could go make my first film without too much overhead. But once I got there, I fell in love with the place and the people.\nWith all your research on the opioid epidemic, did you see a lot of people who were using them for actual pain management and were successful and using responsibly? I feel like pain management patients get lumped in with heroin addicts and puts a stigma on their treatment. Do you have any thoughts on that after putting this together? Thank you.|I was not aware of that aspect of the epidemic until our festival run, when it was brought up in a Q+A. However, there have been a few comments regarding it in this AMA and I'm gonna dive into it.\nHow many years did you teach before your realized kids aren't the future, robots are?|Taught for about four years. Realized this on day one and just went along for the ride.\nHow'd you know lightning was gonna happen *right there*?!|Stood out there for a while haha. It was a pretty big lightning storm and I knew it would come my way eventually.\nHello fellow Rockland native! What steps do you think we collectively as a society need to take to curb such rampant destructive drug use?|Hello hello Rocklandite (is that a thing?)\n |It's obviously a very complicated subject with no simple outs. But briefly, I would push towards a system that focuses on rehabilitation rather than punitive measures. See Andrew Wang's proposal or the model Portugal implemented ten years ago with incredible results.\nHi, this looks amazing! Question, how long did the whole process take? From deciding you want to tackle this project until completion then submitting it into film festivals?|I decided to go to Camden and left the next week. I filmed for a year straight then came back trying to work freelance/raise funds. Then I went back and forth the next few months on weekends.\n |Start to finish (festivals) ? 2.5 3 years. Would have been 2 or less with proper funding/crew.\nI’m so excited to watch this tonight with my husband. He grew up with a lot of exposure to the hardened real world and I was incredibly sheltered. Ironically, I used to attend Junior national rowing regattas in Camden in high school, so I’m incredibly nervous to see what was just streets away from my polished times in the city. Now for my question: has your worldview shifted negatively or positively (or not at all) based on your experiences? Were you exposed to the challenges others faced or were you more sheltered as a kiddo?|I was not sheltered as a kid at all and grew up in a pretty nomadic way, being exposed to many different cultures/peoples and their struggles.\n |So while these new experiences no longer shift my perspective all that much, I love that I work in a field that gives me the opportunity to share these stories and people with others, such as yourself and your husband.\n |Make sure you get back to me after the viewing with what you thought ;)\nI haven't watched it, but I plan to later on. I am always curious about documentary participants. Did any of them glorify their addictions, and life obstacles, almost as if they were a celebrity due to the camera?|That's a great question but I don't think our characters did that. If anything they downplayed their obstacles and struggles, probably out of shame.\n |Enjoy the film, would love any feedback when you're done.\nIs the city really all that dangerous? When I was a kid I was told the colors gangs would drive by me but to be honest the drug dealers pretty much kept to themselves because if they didn't the cops just came in and busted everybody.|No, I think it's probably overblown. The city and the people are amazing and resilient.\nWow how cool! Fellow teacher (although still teaching) here and I'm currently being tasked to put together their video production crew. Any tips for teaching video production? Any possibility of getting an interview with you? 🥳|Oh I would love to! Let's hop on a zoom with your students. Or just you haha.\nDid you enroll in Teach for America or New York City Teaching Fellows Program? (I did. Thought I would quit or transfer out in under 5 years. I stayed for fifteen).|No, I did a TEFL course abroad and bounced around between SE Asia and Europe. Thought I would stay 6 months. Stayed nearly 4 years.\nThat's pretty cool. Did you do this as a result of something else? It reminds me a bit of Chris Arnade's journey to do Dignity.|It was just where I was at in my life, I needed to make the jump into something I loved or be stuck forever.\n |I haven't heard of Chris Arnade but will check him out!\nHow can I watch this in the UK? This looks like a very powerful film.|We haven't released abroad as of yet, but that's coming soon. If you follow us on social we will announce when we do. OR, I've read in this thread that ppl are having luck with VPNs.\n |Thanks for the support!\nDid you generally feel pretty safe, or no?|Yes. Especially after the first few months.\nDo you think you’ll ever return to teaching? I’m interested to know your thoughts on if/how you’d return to the profession.|My mom wants me too that's for sure.\n |I absolutely loved it and would consider it down the road as a part-time gig possibly.\nAny options to be able to watch in the UK? None of the links on the website work|Yeah it's North American only :(\n |We will have our international release within the next few months. I've read that some people on here are having luck with a VPN.\nToo late to the party, but what YouTubes did.you watch to \"learn all things film\", and what did you shoot on?|I didn't have one specific channel, bounced around a lot. I can dig a little deeper to find some of my favs though.\n |Shot on Sony A7s.\nDid you pay the people in your documentary?|No.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nAre you doing anything to help support them with whatever profits you may be getting from filming them? Just makes me think of the weird confusing thin line of being potentially exploitative as a documentary filmmaker, specifically when documenting communities we aren’t directly from or familiar with.|Yeah it's really tough. We supported them in other ways throughout the filming process and since. Help with rent, gas, etc. We have also helped and will continue to help all of them getting into programs if/when they are ready.\nDo you have any plans for your next Documentary? Or will you try something else?|I'm currently between Iraq/Syria/Turkey wrapping my next documentary about the Yazidi genocide and missing 3000 Yazidis in ISIS captivity.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nWhat has that experience been like?|Eye opening. Wonderful. A bit scary.\nI just \"drove\" through Camden on Streetview, and wow, you are brave! What was the most threatened you ever felt by the residents of Camden?|Never! I went in there scared shitless but towards the end I was just worried about stepping in shit or onto needles. Or falling through a roof again.\n |The city is struggling and has been for a while. But the people are amazing and incredibly resilient.\nWow dude. Amazing. Super inspirational. What is the music/song used in the trailer?|Thank you.\n |It's an original score by the amazing John McDowell. We are working on getting the soundtrack onto spotify.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nBrilliant. I can’t wait. It’s very beautiful. Also, when you where shooting at night how well did the Sony do? Did it need much tinkering or did it just do pretty well running on Auto?|Thank you! Yeah it's great at night, but you have to play with the settings a bit. I tried to shoot night scenes with my 55mm fixed lens at 1.8 Fstop. But even with my go-to 24-70 most night scenes came out great! Especially after I learned what I was doing.\nWere you wearing body armour when in Camden?|I had a vest that I would wear when filming with police or swat. I wore it to certain drug houses as well to start with but ditched it a few months in.\nIs there any way us fans down under can watch the film where it’s not region blocked?|Our international release is coming soon! Some people on this thread have had luck with VPNs.\nwhich camera did you buy?|As7ii. Still my go-to\nWas quitting your job impulsive or planned?|Sort of planned. The film part was impulsive though.\nwhich awards did you win? how long did it take for u to make this why did you pick this area, did you know about it?|Slamdance Film Festival: Grand Jury Award Best Feature Documentary\n |2x Brooklyn Film Festival: Spirit Award, Best New Director\n |2x Flicker's Rhode Island International Film Festival: Best Feature Documentary, Best editor\n |Crossing the Screen International Film Festival: Best Feature Documentary\n |Atlanta DocuFest: Best Director\n |Stony Brook Film Festival: Spirit of Independent Filming Award\n |About 2.5 years start to finish. And my father was from Camden, so I was always curious.\nDid you have to set boundaries with any of the addicts when it came to helping them acquire drugs? Already rented and watched on YouTube, I’m so proud of Daryl. Amazing work!|Thank you for supporting and yes Daryl is an amazing human! I'll talk to him tomorrow and pass on your words :)\n |Hard boundary was that I would never pay for it.\nAre you receiving unemployment benefits?|Tough for freelancers. Tougher for freelancers who haven't had any real income while working on passion projects ;)\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nWhat is tough is for my tax dollars to subsidize you playing around with your camcorder.|Wild.\n |Read again. I'm not on unemployment.\n |Although there certainly wouldn't be anything wrong with playing with my camcorder on your tax dollar.\n[Most dangerous cities?](https://www.tapinto.net/towns/camden/sections/law-and-justice/articles/camden-sees-crime-drop-over-past-decade)|Improving, possibly.\n |Continuously one of the country's most dangerous cities for the last few decades? Without a doubt.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nRelative to what though? Put it in perspective.|Not relative to anything. Ranked, continuously, for the last few decades. Like this one (2020): https://www.americancityandcounty.com/galleries/2020s-10-most-dangerous-u-s-cities/\n |Or this one (2015) (https://theboxhouston.com/1935471/f-b-i-releases-new-list-of-the-most-dangerous-cities-in-america-did-your-city-make-the-list/)\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nOK but compared to a city like Tiajuana Camden looks like a daycare.|Sure, but I did say, \"one of AMERICA'S most dangerous cities\" in the blurb.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nAnd I’m trying to put that in perspective due to the sea of circlejerk that is Reddit.|Got it. No worries ;)\nHey! I live near Camden. I worry about the title of this post and that it might permeate stereotypes for BIPOC. Are you concerned about that?|Hey, thanks for the very valid question. Hope you're doing well down in/near Camden.\n |I don't think the title perpetuates any sort of stereotypes about Camden or BIPOC, no.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nI think it's the title of the post I'd caution you to look at and how you portray danger. Or dangerous environments.|Noted. I would add though, that it IS one of America's most dangerous cities. I wasn't using hyperbole.\nFresno?|Camden, NJ.\nHas the success so far with this film made enough money to continue and live from? Is the future looking like more bootstrapping, or have you found sponsors or connections make enough to keep doing this? Looks like a great film. I'll have to give it a watch, and keep an eye out from the next one it sounds like you're working on.|This film was used as a stepping stone into my current project, which has more support and I will actually be able to pay myself.\n |While filming HIGHER LOVE I had to get a part time and then full time freelance position towards the end.\nI live in Camden but not in Camden. I have accounts I visit there and one thing I learned real quick is to keep your eyes low. If you accidentally pull up and see some guys hanging out in the corner, they saw you pull in and are trying to figure you out quickly. If your wondering why they’re looking at you, don’t stare at them trying to figure it out. Just continue on with what you were doing. Think about it later. Other times, I’ve had to pull over to do some work stuff real quick and turns out I parked in front of someone’s house, who doesn’t like visitors. I didn’t notice them watching me. I pulled away and this dude jumped in his car and sped after me and cut me off. Stopped me and yelled “were you writing down my cars information?!” I had to explain what I was doing and the dude said alright and left. That being said, I’ve also met some incredibly nice people day and night. They’re all trying to get by. Where you able to meet the nice side of Camden? IE the people who live there? I can’t wait to watch the shit out of this.|Yes, I met many amazing people in the city. Thanks for the support! Hope you enjoy the film and that it rings true to someone from the city itself.\nI know I’m late to the party but had to comment. Your trailer is amazing and I’m going to watch the whole thing this weekend. I’ve always been fascinated by abandoned places and grew up not far from Camden. I have been in NYC for over a decade now and abandoned places are not something we see here anymore but, we certainly do see abandoned people. I feel like your documentary is bringing those people to a wider audience. I feel like you give a story to people that most are comfortable labeling as junkies and moving on. There’s a person, family, and traumas when you dig deeper and that’s far harder to ignore/write off. I really loved how you value and highlight their humanity and give a voice to a largely voiceless and marginalized community. I guess that really wasn’t an AMA more of a comment so here’s my question… single/married? And... I’ll let myself out...|I'm going to steal some of this for my next in person AMA if that's ok haha. Really so well put and couldn't agree more.\n |Single. Marriage in the future if this job allows ;)\nHave you ever tried opioids or other hard drugs? What made you interested in the lifestyle to film it?|I have never, no.\n |It wasn't the drug use or addiction that attracted me to the project, but rather the amazing characters and their stories.\nHey Hasan, I think the idea for the film is amazing. I went to college and lived in Camden, NJ for three years and so I always love seeing it represented. When I first decided on Camden, I had some preconceived notions about the city and while it is one of the most dangerous areas in the country as you mentioned, the city has a beautiful underbelly filled with history and vibrant residents that should be the key to changing the narrative. My question is what were your thoughts and biases going into the project regarding Camden, and did they change by the end and how?|My biases were probably exactly same ones that the rest of the America (or those who have heard of it) hold. Hellhole, nuke it, pull themselves up by they bootstraps, etc. etc. Of course, not to this degree.\n |That's why I chose the opening radio Opie and Anthony montage that I did.\n |But that's why I wanted to go explore this city and meet these people, because I knew that I probably had it wrong and that the media had it wrong.\n |And I/they did have it wrong. Sure it's a city with its struggles but it's a it's a resilient city filled with amazing people. Walt Whitman, Campbells, the ship yards. Cities like Camden built America and now have just been left to rot.\nHi! Have you seen Lost Boys? documentary about Finnish opioid addicts? http://catalogue.ses.fi/movies/lost-boys/ Any toughts on that or the earlier film from the same director: [reindeer spotting](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584813/)? Any toughts on these? Im eager to see your film as well, it's important that these documentaries are being made all around the world to spread the knowledge about this terrible disease.|I have seen it. Or parts of it of both.\n |I will have to watch again and see what thoughts I have. But I remember being inspired by his access and raw verite style.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nLost Boys is a lot different, more artistic and political. The message is \"it's not all about the drugs\" Poor boys from Rovaniemi Lapland travel to do drugs and meet up with poor girls of Laos. Some kind of love affair. And yeah, cheers from Rovaniemi.|Cool I will rewatch. Cheers from Harlem, NY!\nHow did you get access to the subjects in the film and get them to participate? Just wondering if maybe anyone reading this (commenting late) knows how that side of things work? Unless I was being given money or drugs, not sure i'd want to be filmed at my lowest point in life. Film looks really well done!|Great question. I think it is a combination of ego and truly wanting to get your story heard. With many, many other facets piled on.\nHey, thanks for being so thorough and answering so many questions for posters. What software did you use in the beginning for editing and arrangement? Did you do all of the initial stuff yourself? (Color grading, audio work, etc.) Or, did you end up working with someone else or hiring for contract work?|No problem! I'm enjoying it, surprisingly :) I used final cut pro x to start and then moved to Premier Pro. I used temp music, doing basic coloring and audio tweaks myself. Once I had a 30 minute cut, I brought on a real editor, colorist, composer, audio tech, etc\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nThanks for the reply dude! Was the switch over to Premier easy/worth it for you, or would you have kept using FCPX if you had continued to do mostly solo production?|So easy and so worth it. I liked FCX but everyone in the industry was using PP so I had to switch. I would advise you do likewise or workflow between parties will be tough.\nHow do you deal with filming conversations or scenes that are hard to witness? Any time I'm in that situation I feel somewhat guilty for filming such a tender moment even when they've agreed to be filmed on paper.|It was really tough at times, but I do think the camera provides a bit of a filter. A way to remove oneself.\n |I do find that I am now dealing with a lot of things from my time filming there. So I guess I pushed a lot of the more traumatic aspects aside so I could finish filming.\nI'm late to the show but I'm wondering how you went about getting distribution. I made a film (zero budget) that's about to be distributed on American public television. Who do I go to for the next step? TIA|We went the festival route. So festivals, sales agent, distributor, VOD platforms.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nThank you and congratulations! Can’t wait to watch it. My film is: www.findingthevirgo.com.|Very cool I'll check it out!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nAny chance you can share the name of your sales agent?|Sure. DM me\nI just rented the film on Amazon. For a 48 hour rental it cost $4.99. How much of that rental fee will you see? Or did they pay you to put it on their site? I’d rather just send you the money directly|Thanks for the support! It varies platform to platform but I would guess about 70-75 percent on average.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nGreat film. Would be dope to see an update in like 5 years|Thanks for watching! I agree. I can't wait to follow up with Nez especially.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nMan I hope the best for Nez. Seems like Daryl is a good father. Ps I’d love to see a newer version of Dope Sick Love (on HBO) major vibes off your film. If you haven’t seen it check it out|Yeah I love that film!\nHi, I'm not able to watch the documentary in my region but are you able to explain very briefly how there can be an opioid epidemic to a non american? Getting such drugs where I live wouldn't be easy.|Oh I love Germany, lived in Bremen for a bit. Follow us on social media as we will announce our international release soon. We really want to get this story out to as many people and places as possible.\n |There are SO many factors that go into the opioid epidemic, but doctors overprescribing pain pills to patients, who then eventually turn to the much cheaper street drugs, is probably a good place to start. Also, big Pharma in our country should be held most responsible.\nThis is very timely -- what's the best way to get a hold of you for someone who wants to do something very similar, but about a medical issue? Hayyyyy :)|Thank you! Find me on instagram (higherlovefilm)\nHow did you go about distributing this film across all of the listed platforms? Amazing work. Did the film festivals help with distribution?|Sorry missed a few somehow. We did well in the festivals and were approached by sales agents and disributors.\nDude, come on. It's 2021. Why region lock this when you're releasing it digitally? What do you expect to gain from that?|I wish it was my choice! Trust me, we want this out as widely as possible. It's the choice of our distributor to sell different regions at different times, we had no say in the matter.\nWere you ever afraid during work that something might go wrong? Get attacked or ambushed? How did you deal with it?|Copied from below:\n |I went in there scared shitless but towards the end, I was just worried about stepping in shit or onto needles. Or falling through a roof again.\n |The city is struggling and has been for a while. But the people are amazing and incredibly resilient.\nHow close did you come to pairing the relationship of the Vietnam War to Increased Opioid Usage in America?|Many of our interviewees (while we still had interviews in the film) made that connection. Specifically, the DEA head first brought it to our attention.\nI am an addict and have been in recovery for 6 years. Was it shocking to see the lifestyle first hand?|I would be interested to see your reaction of the film. And good on you, 6 years is incredible! Congrats.\n |It was at first shocking but I became numb to it after a few weeks.\nDid you ever use drugs before deciding to make the film or was this your first exposure to drug use?|I've done drugs recreationally before but this was my first real exposure to hardcore addiction and drug use.\n |I had never seen someone inject, for example. Or OD.\nHow with no crew did you end up filming dangerous criminals without getting into danger yourself??|We built mutual trust. They are humans just like any of us, who have just fallen on hard times.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nYeah of course, just admire your approach to this. I've seen people struggling with drug addiction and the lengths they will go to, to get cash or their hit, is a risk to be caught up in those areas. Big kudos to you for your moral/respect. Can't wait to watch the film - waiting on UK Times..!|Thank you my friend.\nDid it make any money? How did you afford not having a job for the making of the film and now?|It's making money now, but it's been tough, not gonna lie.\n |I've freelanced and had a salaried position at a big editing house off and on since.\nWhat gear did you use for this? How did you like filming with your camera?|A7sii with 24-70 Zeiss.\n |Rode Vid Pro+ camera top mic.\n |DJI Phantom 3 (till it caught on fire after crashing into a pool).\n |Yes, I loved filming with the A7s and use it still.\nYou are crazy! What were you feeling when the film was ready?|Complete relief. But I didn't get to really enjoy the ride until the festival run.\ndid you get a cheesesteak from Donkey’s?|\"a\" ??!?!\nLooking for interns for future projects?|YES.\nWhat kind of camera did you buy?|Sony a7sii\nWhat is next on your journey?|I'm currently between Syria/Iraq wrapping a film on the Yazidi genocide.\ndid you visit the aquarium?|I haven't. Those places make me sad. Especially with the Norcross tax thievery that made that particular one happen.\nAmazing! Dogs or cats?|Dogs\nWhy not Chicago ?|Camden was a short drive. Chicago was an airplane ticket ;)\n |But you make a good point. Camden could be any number of cities across America.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|\nIt would be cool to do a series about it maybe one day it’ll be picked up by Netflix or discovery channel like true crimes|Agreed.",
